# 14.408-2 Responsible bidder-reasonableness of price

(a) The contracting officer  shall  determine that a prospective contractor is responsible (see subpart

9.1) and that the prices offered are reasonable before awarding the contract. The price analysis

techniques in 15.404-1 (b) may be used as guidelines. In each case the determination shall  be made

in the light of all prevailing circumstances. Particular care must  be taken in cases where only a

single bid is received.

(b) The price analysis shall  consider whether bids are materially unbalanced (see 15.404-1 (g)).
