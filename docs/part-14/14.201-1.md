# 14.201-1 Uniform contract format

(a) Contracting officers  shall  prepare invitations for bids and contracts using the uniform contract

format outlined in Table 14-1 to the maximum practicable extent. The use of the format facilitates

preparation of the solicitation  and contract as well as reference to, and use of, those documents by

bidders and contractors. It need not be used for acquisition  of the following:

(1) Construction  (see part  36 ).

(2) Shipbuilding (including design, construction , and conversion), ship overhaul, and ship repair.

(3) Subsistence items.

(4) Supplies  or services requiring special contract forms prescribed elsewhere in this regulation that

are inconsistent with the uniform contract format.

(5) Firm-fixed-price or fixed-price with economic price adjustment acquisitions  that use the

simplified contract format (see [14.201-9](/part-14/14.201-9) ).

(b) Information suitable for inclusion in invitations for bids under the uniform contract format shall

also be included in invitations for bids not subject to that format if applicable.

(c) Solicitations  to which the uniform contract format applies shall  include PartsI, II, III, and IV. If

any section of the uniform contract format does not apply, the contracting officer  should  so mark

that section in the solicitation . Upon award, the contracting officer  shall  not physically include

PartIV in the resulting contract, but shall  retain it in the contract file. (See [14.201](/part-14/14.201) (c).) Award by

acceptance of a bid on the award portion of Standard Form 33 , Solicitation , Offer  and Award

(SF 33 ), Standard Form 26 , Award/Contract ( SF 26 ), or Standard Form 1447 , Solicitation /Contract

(SF 1447 ), incorporates Section K, Representations, certifications, and other statements of bidders,

in the resultant contract even though not physically attached. The representations and certifications

shall  be incorporated by reference in the contract by using [52.204-19](/part-52/52.204-19)  (see 4.1202 (b)) or for

acquisitions  of commercial products  and commercial services  see [52.212-4](/part-52/52.212-4) (v).
