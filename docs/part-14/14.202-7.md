# 14.202-7 Facsimile bids

(a) Unless prohibited or otherwise restricted by agency procedures, contracting officers  may

authorize facsimile bids (see 14.201-6 (v)). In determining whether or not to authorize facsimile bids,

the contracting officer  shall  consider factors such as-

(1) Anticipated bid size and volume;

(2) Urgency of the requirement;

(3) Frequency of price changes;

(4) Availability, reliability, speed, and capacity of the receiving facsimile equipment; and

(5) Adequacy of administrative procedures and controls for receiving, identifying, recording, and

safeguarding facsimile bids, and ensuring their timely delivery to the bids opening location.

(b) If facsimile bids are authorized, contracting officers  may, after the date set for bid opening,

request the apparently successful offeror  to provide the complete, original signed bid.
