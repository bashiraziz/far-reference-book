# 13.104 and the following before requesting quotations or offers :

(1)

(i) The nature of the article or service to be purchased and whether it is highly competitive and

readily available in several makes or brands, or is relatively noncompetitive.

(ii) An electronic commerce  method that employs widespread electronic public notice is not

available; and

(iii) The urgency of the proposed purchase.

(iv) The dollar value of the proposed purchase.

(v) Past experience concerning specific dealers’ prices.

(2)

(i) When soliciting quotations or offers , the contracting officer  shall  notify potential quoters or

offerors  of the basis on which award will be made (price alone or price and other factors, e.g., past

performance  and quality).

(ii) Contracting officers  are encouraged to use best value .

(iii) Solicitations  are not required to state the relative importance assigned to each evaluation factor

and subfactor, nor are they required to include subfactors.

(iv) In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 3206(c) , for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard—

(A) The contracting officer  may choose not to include price or cost as an evaluation factor for award

when a solicitation —

(1) Has an estimated value above the simplified acquisition threshold ;

(2) Will result in multiple-award contracts  (see subpart [16.5](/part-16/16.5)) that are for the same or similar

services; and

(3) States that the Government intends to make an award to each and all qualifying offerors  (see

[2.101](/part-2/2.101)).

(B) If the contracting officer  chooses not to include price or cost as an evaluation factor for the

contract award, in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, the contracting officer

shall  consider price or cost as one of the factors in the selection decision for each order placed

under the contract.

(C) The exception in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(A) of this section shall  not apply to solicitations  for

multiple-award contracts  that provide for sole source orders pursuant to section 8(a) of the Small

Business Act ( 15 U.S.C. 637 (a)).

(v) Except for DoD, contracting officers  shall  ensure the criteria at [15.101-2](/part-15/15.101-2) (c)(1)-(5) are met when

using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process.

(vi) Except for DoD, avoid using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process to

acquire certain supplies  and services in accordance with [15.101-2](/part-15/15.101-2) (d).

(b) Soliciting from a single source.

(1) For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold .

(i) Contracting officers  may solicit from one source if the contracting officer  determines that the

circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available ( e.g., urgency,

exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization).

(ii) Where a single source is identified to provide a portion of a purchase because that portion of the

purchase specifies a particular brand-name item, the documentation in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this

section only applies to the portion of the purchase requiring the brand-name item. The

documentation should  state it is covering only the portion of the acquisition  which is brand-name.

(2) For purchases exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold . The requirements at [13.501](/part-13/13.501) (a)

apply to sole-source (including brand-name) acquisitions  of commercial products  and commercial

services  conducted pursuant to subpart [13.5](/part-13/13.5).

(3) See [5.102](/part-5/5.102) (a)(6) for the requirement to post the brand-name justification or documentation.

(c) Soliciting orally.

(1) The contracting officer  shall  solicit quotations orally to the maximum extent practicable, if-

(i) The acquisition  does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold ;

(ii) Oral solicitation  is more efficient than soliciting through available electronic commerce

alternatives; and

(iii) Notice is not required under [5.101](/part-5/5.101) .

(2) However, an oral solicitation  may not be practicable for contract actions exceeding $25,000

unless covered by an exception in [5.202](/part-5/5.202) .

(d) Written solicitations . If obtaining electronic or oral quotations is uneconomical or impracticable,

the contracting officer  should  issue paper solicitations  for contract actions likely to exceed $25,000.

The contracting officer  shall  issue a written solicitation  for construction  requirements exceeding

$2,000.

(e) Use of options . Options  may be included in solicitations , provided the requirements of subpart

[17.2](/part-17/17.2) are met and the aggregate value of the acquisition  and all options  does not exceed the dollar

threshold for use of simplified acquisition procedures .

(f) Inquiries.  An agency should  respond to inquiries received through any medium (including

electronic commerce ) if doing so would not interfere with the efficient conduct of the acquisition .
