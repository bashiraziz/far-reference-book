# 12.214 Cost Accounting Standards

Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) do not apply to contracts and subcontracts  for the acquisition  of

commercial products  or commercial services  when these contracts and subcontracts  are firm-fixed-

price or fixed-price with economic price adjustment (provided that the price adjustment is not based

on actual costs incurred). See 30.201-1  for CAS applicability to fixed-price with economic price

adjustment contracts and subcontracts  for commercial products  or commercial services  when the

price adjustment is based on actual costs incurred. When CAS applies, the contracting officer  shall

insert the appropriate provisions and clauses as prescribed in 30.201 .
