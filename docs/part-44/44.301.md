# 44.301 Objective

The objective of a contractor purchasing system review (CPSR) is to evaluate the efficiency and

effectiveness with which the contractor spends Government funds and complies with Government

policy when subcontracting. The review provides the administrative contracting officer  (ACO) a basis

for granting, withholding, or withdrawing approval of the contractor’s purchasing system.
