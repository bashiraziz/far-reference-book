# 30.603-2 Unilateral and desirable changes

(a) Unilateral changes .

(1) The contractor may unilaterally change its disclosed or established cost accounting practices, but

the Government shall  not pay any increased cost, in the aggregate, as a result of the unilateral

change .

(2) Prior to making any contract price or cost adjustments under the applicable paragraph (s)

addressing a unilateral change  at [52.230-2](/part-52/52.230-2) , [52.230-3](/part-52/52.230-3) , or [52.230-5](/part-52/52.230-5) , the CFAO shall  determine that-

(i) The contemplated contract price or cost adjustments will protect the Government from the

payment of the estimated increased costs, in the aggregate; and

(ii) The net effect of the contemplated adjustments will not result in the recovery of more than the

increased costs to the Government, in the aggregate.

(b) Desirable changes .

(1) Prior to taking action under the applicable paragraph (s) addressing a desirable change  at

[52.230-2](/part-52/52.230-2) , [52.230-3](/part-52/52.230-3) , or [52.230-5](/part-52/52.230-5) , the CFAO shall  determine the change is a desirable change  and not

detrimental to the interests of the Government.

(2) Until the CFAO has determined a change to a cost accounting practice is a desirable change , the

change is a unilateral change .

(3) Some factors to consider in determining if a change is desirable include, but are not limited to,

whether-

(i) The contractor must  change the cost accounting practices it uses for Government contract and

subcontract costing purposes to remain in compliance with the provisions of part  31 ;

(ii) The contractor is initiating management actions directly associated with the change that will

result in cost savings for segments  with CAS-covered contracts and subcontracts over a period for

which forward pricing  rates are developed or 5 years, whichever is shorter, and the cost savings are

reflected in the forward pricing  rates; and

(iii) Funds are available if the determination would necessitate an upward adjustment of contract

cost or price.

(c) Notice and proposal preparation.

(1) When a contractor makes a unilateral change , the clause at [52.230-6](/part-52/52.230-6) , Administration of Cost

Accounting Standards, requires the contractor to-

(i) Submit a description of the change to the CFAO not less than 60 days (or other mutually

agreeable date) before implementation of the change; and

(ii) Submit rationale to support any contractor written statement that the cost impact of the change

is immaterial.

(2) If a contractor implements the change in cost accounting practice without submitting the notice

as required in paragraph (c)(1) of this subsection, the CFAO may determine the change a failure to

follow a cost accounting practice consistently and process it as a noncompliance  in accordance with
