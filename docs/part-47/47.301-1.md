# 47.301-1 Responsibilities of contracting officers

(a) Contracting officers  shall  obtain from traffic management offices transportation factors required

for-

(1) Solicitations  and awards; and

(2) Contract administration, modification, and termination, including the movement of property by

the Government to and from contractors’ plants.

(b) Contracting officers  shall  request transportation office participation especially before making an

initial acquisition  of supplies  that are unusually large, heavy, high, wide, or long; have sensitive or

dangerous characteristics; or lend themselves to containerized movements from the source. In

determining total transportation charges, contracting officers  shall  also consider additional costs

arising from factors such as the use of special equipment, excess blocking and bracing material, or

circuitous routing.
