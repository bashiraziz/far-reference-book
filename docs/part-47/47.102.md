(1) Retains the risk of loss of and/or damage to its property that is not the legal liability of

commercial carriers  and

U.S.C. 17307 ). (See part  28 , Bonds and Insurance .)

(b) Under special circumstances the Government may, if such action is considered necessary and in

the Government’s interest, (1) buy insurance  coverage for Government property or (2) require the

carrier  to (i) assume full responsibility for loss of or damage to the Government property in its

possession and (ii) buy insurance  to cover the carrier ’s assumed responsibility. The cost of this

insurance  to the carrier  shall  be part of the transportation cost. (The Secretary of the Treasury

contracting officer  shall  ascertain that-
