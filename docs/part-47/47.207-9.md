# 47.207-9 Annotation and distribution of shipping and billing documents

(a) The contracting officer  shall  state in detail the responsibilities of the contractor, the contracting

agency, and, if appropriate, the consignee for the annotation and distribution of shipping and billing

documents. See 41 CFR part 102 -118, Transportation Payment and Audit.

(b) In instances of mass movements of freight  made available to the contractor at one time, it is

particularly important that the contracting officer  specifies that bills of lading be cross-referenced so

that the Government benefits from applicable volume rates.

(c) The contracting officer  shall  insert the clause at [52.247-28](/part-52/52.247-28) , Contractor’s Invoices , in drayage or

other term contracts.
