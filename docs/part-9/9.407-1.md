# 9.407-1 General

(a) The suspending and debarring official  may, in the public interest, suspend a contractor for any of

the causes in 9.407-2 , using the procedures in 9.407-3 .

(b)

(1) Suspension  is a serious action to be imposed on the basis of adequate evidence , pending the

completion of an investigation or legal proceedings, when it has been determined that immediate

action is necessary to protect the Government's interest. In deciding whether immediate action is

necessary to protect the Government's interest, the suspending and debarring official  has wide

discretion. The suspending and debarring official  may infer the necessity for immediate action to

protect the Government's interest either from the nature of the circumstances giving rise to a cause

for suspension  or from potential business relationships or involvement with a program of the Federal

Government. In assessing the adequacy of the evidence, agencies should  consider how much

information is available, how credible it is given the circumstances, whether or not important

allegations are corroborated, and what inferences can reasonably be drawn as a result. This

assessment should  include an examination of basic documents such as contracts, inspection  reports,

and correspondence. An indictment or other official findings by Federal, State, or local bodies that

determine factual and/or legal matters, constitutes adequate evidence  for purposes of suspension

actions.

(2) The existence of a cause for suspension  does not necessarily require that the contractor be

suspended. The suspending and debarring official  should  consider the seriousness of the

contractor's acts or omissions and may, but is not required to, consider remedial measures,

mitigating factors, or aggravating factors, such as those in 9.406-1 (a). A contractor has the burden

of promptly presenting to the suspending and debarring official  evidence of remedial measures or

mitigating factors when it has reason to know that a cause for suspension  exists. The existence or

nonexistence of any remedial measures or aggravating or mitigating factors is not necessarily

determinative of a contractor's present responsibility.

(c) Suspension  constitutes suspension  of all divisions or other organizational elements of the

contractor, unless the suspension  decision is limited by its terms to specific divisions, organizational

elements, or commodities. The suspending and debarring official  may extend the suspension

decision to include any affiliates  of the contractor if they are-

(1) Specifically named; and

(2) Given written notice of the suspension  and an opportunity to respond (see 9.407-3 (c)).

(d) A contractor’s suspension  shall  be effective throughout the executive branch of the Government,

unless the agency head  or a designee (except see 26.505 (e)) states in writing  the compelling reasons

justifying continued business dealings between that agency and the contractor.

(e)

(1) When the suspending and debarring official  has authority to suspend contractors from both

contracts pursuant to the Federal Acquisition  Regulation in this chapter and contracts for the

purchase of Federal personal property  pursuant to Federal Management Regulation (FMR) in 41

CFR part 102-38, that official shall  consider simultaneously suspending the contractor from the

award of acquisition  contracts and from the purchase of Federal personal property .

(2) When suspending a contractor from the award of acquisition  contracts and from the purchase of

Federal personal property , the suspension  notice shall  so indicate and the appropriate FAR and FMR

citations shall  be included.
