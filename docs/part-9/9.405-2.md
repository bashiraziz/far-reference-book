# 9.405-2 Restrictions on subcontracting

(a) When a contractor debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment , or voluntarily excluded, is

proposed as a subcontractor for any subcontract subject to Government consent (see subpart  44.2 ),

contracting officers  shall  not consent to subcontracts  with such contractors unless the agency head

states in writing  the compelling reasons for this approval action. (See 9.405  concerning declarations

of ineligibility affecting sub- contracting .)

(b) The Government suspends or debars contractors to protect the Government’s interests.

Contractors are prohibited from entering into any subcontract in excess of $45,000 , other than a

subcontract for a commercially available off-the-shelf item, with a contractor that has been

debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment , or voluntarily excluded, unless there is a compelling

reason to do so. If a contractor intends to enter into a subcontract in excess of $45,000 , other than a

subcontract for a commercially available off-the-shelf item, with a party that is debarred, suspended,

proposed for debarment , or voluntarily excluded, as evidenced by the party's having an active

exclusion record in SAM (see 9.404 ), a corporate officer or designee of the contractor is required by

operation of the clause at 52.209-6 , Protecting the Government’s Interest when Subcontracting with

Contractors Debarred, Suspended, Proposed for Debarment , or Voluntarily Excluded, to notify the

contracting officer , in writing , before entering into such subcontract. For contracts for the

acquisition  of commercial products , the notification requirement applies only for first-tier

subcontracts. For all other contracts, the notification requirement applies to subcontracts at any

tier. The notice must  provide the following:

(1) The name of the subcontractor;

(2) The contractor’s knowledge of the reasons for the subcontractor having an active exclusion

record in SAM;

(3) The compelling reason(s) for doing business with the subcontractor notwithstanding its having

an active exclusion record in SAM; and

(4) The systems and procedures the contractor has established to ensure that it is fully protecting

the Government’s interests when dealing with such subcontractor in view of the specific basis for

the party’s debarment , suspension , proposed debarment , or voluntary exclusion.

(c) The contractor’s compliance with the requirements of 52.209-6  will be reviewed during

Contractor Purchasing System Reviews (see subpart  44.3 ).
