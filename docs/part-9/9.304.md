Normally, testing and approval  is not required in contracts for-

exists (see subpart  [9.2](/part-9/9.2) ));

(c) Products  normally sold in the commercial market; or

(d) Products  covered by complete and detailed technical specifications, unless the requirements are

so novel or exacting that it is questionable whether the products  would meet the requirements

without testing and approval .
