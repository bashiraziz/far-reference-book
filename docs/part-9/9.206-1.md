# 9.206-1 General

(a) Agencies may not enforce any QPL, QML, or QBL without first complying with the requirements

of [9.202](/part-9/9.202) (a). However, qualification requirements  themselves, whether or not previously embodied in

a in a QPL, QML, or QBL, may be enforced without regard to [9.202](/part-9/9.202) (a) if they are in either of the

following categories:

(1) Any qualification requirement  established by statute prior to October 30,1984, for civilian

agencies (not including NASA); or

(2) Any qualification requirement  established by statute or administrative action prior to October

19,1984, for DoD or NASA. Qualification requirements  established after the above dates must

comply with [9.202](/part-9/9.202) (a) to be enforceable.

(b) Except when the agency head  or designee determines that an emergency  exists, whenever an

agency elects, whether before or after award, not to enforce a qualification requirement  which it

established, the requirement may not thereafter be enforced unless the agency complies with
