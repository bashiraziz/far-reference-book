# 48.104-2 Sharing acquisition savings

(a) Supply or service contracts.

(1) The sharing base  for acquisition savings  is the number of affected end items on contracts of the

contracting office  accepting the VECP. The sharing rates (Government/contractor) for net

acquisition savings  for supplies  and services are based on the type of contract, the value engineering

clause or alternate  used, and the type of savings, as follows:

* The contracting officer  may increase the contractor’s sharing rate to as high as 75 percent for

each VECP. (See [48.102](/part-48/48.102) (g) (1) through (7).)

** Same sharing arrangement as the contract’s profit or fee adjustment formula.

*** The contracting officer  may increase the contractor’s sharing rate to as high as 50 percent

for each VECP. (See [48.102](/part-48/48.102) (g) (1) through (7).)

(2) Acquisition savings  may be realized on the instant contract , concurrent contracts, and future

contracts. The contractor is entitled to a percentage share (see paragraph (a)(1)) of any net

acquisition savings . Net acquisition savings  result when the total of acquisition savings  becomes

greater than the total of Government costs  and any negative instant contract savings . This may

occur on the instant contract  or it may not occur until reductions have been negotiated on

concurrent contracts or until future contract savings are calculated, either through lump-sum

payment or as each future contract is awarded.

(i) When the instant contract  is not an incentive contract, the contractor’s share of net acquisition

savings  is calculated and paid each time such savings are realized. This may occur once, several

times, or, in rare cases, not at all.

(ii) When the instant contract  is an incentive contract, the contractor shares in instant contract

savings through the contract’s incentive structure. In calculating acquisition savings  under incentive

contracts, the contracting officer  shall  add any negative instant contract savings  to the target cost or

to the target price and ceiling price and then offset these negative instant contract savings  and any

Government costs  against concurrent and future contract savings.

(3) The contractor shares in the savings on all affected units  scheduled for delivery during the

sharing period . The contractor is responsible for maintaining, for 3 years after final payment on the

contract under which the VECP was accepted, records adequate to identify the first delivered unit

incorporating the applicable VECP.

(4) Contractor shares of savings are paid through the contract under which the VECP was accepted.

On incentive contracts, the contractor’s share of concurrent and future contract savings and of

collateral savings  shall  be paid as a separate firm-fixed-price line item  on the instant contract .

(5) Within 3 months after concurrent contracts have been modified to reflect price reductions

attributable to use of the VECP, the contracting officer  shall  modify the instant contract  to provide

the contractor’s share of savings.

(6) The contractor’s share of future contract savings may be paid as subsequent contracts are

awarded or in a lump-sum payment at the time the VECP is accepted. The lump-sum method may be

used only if the contracting officer  has established that this is the best way to proceed and the

contractor agrees. The contracting officer  ordinarily shall  make calculations as future contracts are

awarded and, within 3 months after award, modify the instant contract  to provide the contractor’s

share of the savings. For future contract savings calculated under the optional lump-sum method,

the sharing base  is an estimate of the number of items that the contracting officer  will purchase for

delivery during the sharing period . In deciding whether or not to use the more convenient lump-sum

method for an individual VECP, the contracting officer  shall  consider-

(i) The accuracy with which the number of items to be delivered during the sharing period  can be

estimated and the probability of actual production of the projected quantity;

(ii) The availability of funds for a lump-sum payment; and

(iii) The administrative expense of amending the instant contract  as future contracts are awarded.

(b) Construction  contracts.  Sharing on construction  contracts applies only to savings on the instant

contract  and to collateral savings . The Government’s share of savings is determined by subtracting

Government costs  from instant contract  savings and multiplying the result by (1)45 percent for

fixed-price contracts or (2)75 percent for cost-reimbursement contracts. Value engineering  sharing

does not apply to incentive construction  contracts.
