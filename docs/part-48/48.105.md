# 48.105 Relationship to other incentives

Contractors should  be offered the fullest possible range of motivation, yet the benefits of an

accepted VECP should  not be rewarded both as value engineering  shares and under performance,

design-to-cost , or similar incentives of the contract. To that end, when performance, design-to-cost ,

or similar targets are set and incentivized, the targets of such incentives affected by the VECP are

not to be adjusted because of the acceptance of the VECP. Only those benefits of an accepted VECP

not rewardable under other incentives are rewarded under a value engineering  clause.
