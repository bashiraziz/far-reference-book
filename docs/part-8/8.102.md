# 8.102 Policy.

When practicable, agencies shall use excess personal property as the first source of supply for agency and cost-reimbursement contractor requirements. Agency personnel shall make positive efforts to satisfy agency requirements by obtaining and using excess personal property (including that suitable for adaptation or substitution) before initiating a contract action.
