# 42.903 Solicitation provision and contract clause

The contracting officer  shall  insert the clause at [52.242-13](/part-52/52.242-13) , Bankruptcy, in all solicitations  and

contracts exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold .

Subpart [42.10](/part-42/42.10)  - [Reserved]

Subpart [42.11](/part-42/42.11)  - Production Surveillance and Reporting

42.1101  General.

Production surveillance is a function of contract administration used to determine contractor

progress and to identify any factors that may delay performance. Production surveillance involves

Government review and analysis of-

(a) Contractor performance plans, schedules, controls, and industrial processes; and

(b) The contractor’s actual performance under them.

42.1102  Applicability.

This subpart applies to all contracts for supplies  or services other than construction  contracts, and

Federal Supply Schedule contracts. See part  37 , especially subpart  [37.6](/part-37/37.6) , regarding surveillance of

contracts for services.

42.1103  Policy.

The contractor is responsible for timely contract performance. The Government will maintain

surveillance of contractor performance as necessary to protect its interests. When the contracting

office  retains a contract for administration, the contracting officer  administering the contract shall

determine the extent of surveillance.

42.1104  Surveillance requirements.

(a) The contract administration office  determines the extent of production surveillance on the basis

of-

(1) The criticality (degree of importance to the Government) assigned by the contracting officer  (see

42.1105 ) to the supplies  or services; and

(2) Consideration of the following factors:

(i) Contract requirements for reporting production progress and performance.

(ii) The contract performance schedule.

(iii) The contractor’s production plan.

(iv) The contractor’s history of contract performance.

(v) The contractor’s experience with the contract supplies  or services.

(vi) The contractor’s financial capability.

(vii) Any supplementary written instructions from the contracting office .

(b) Contracts at or below the simplified acquisition threshold  should  not normally require production

surveillance.

(c) In planning and conducting surveillance, contract administration offices  shall  make maximum use

of any reliable contractor production control or data management systems.

(d) In performing surveillance, contract administration office  personnel shall  avoid any action that

may-

(1) Be inconsistent with any contract requirement; or

(2) Result in claims  of waivers, of changes, or of other contract modifications .

42.1105  Assignment of criticality designator.

Contracting officers  shall  assign a criticality designator to each contract in the space for designating

the contract administration office , as follows:

Criticality

DesignatorCriterion

ACritical contracts, including DX-rated contracts (see subpart  [11.6](/part-11/11.6) ),

contracts citing the authority in [6.302-2](/part-6/6.302-2)  (unusual and compelling

urgency), and contracts for major systems .

BContracts (other than those designated "A") for items needed to maintain

a Government or contractor production or repair line, to preclude out-of-

stock conditions or to meet user needs for nonstock items.

C All contracts other than those designated "A" or "B."

42.1106  Reporting requirements.

(a) When information on contract performance status is needed, contracting officers  may require

contractors to submit production progress reports (see 42.1107 (a)). Reporting requirements shall  be

limited to that information essential to Government needs and shall  take maximum advantage of

data output generated by contractor management systems.

(b) Contract administration offices  shall  review and verify the accuracy of contractor reports and

advise the contracting officer  of any required action. The accuracy of contractor-prepared reports

shall  be verified either by a program of continuous surveillance of the contractor’s report-

preparation system or by individual review of each report.

(c) The contract administration office  may at any time initiate a report to advise the contracting

officer  (and the inventory manager, if one is designated in the contract) of any potential or actual

delay in performance. This advice shall -

(1) Be in writing ;

(2) Be provided in sufficient time for the contracting officer  to take necessary action; and

(3) Provide a definite recommendation, if action is appropriate.

42.1107  Contract clause.

(a) The contracting officer  shall  insert the clause at [52.242-2](/part-52/52.242-2) , Production Progress Reports, in

solicitations  and contracts when production progress reporting is required; unless a construction

contract, or a Federal Supply Schedule contract is contemplated.

(b) When the clause at [52.242-2](/part-52/52.242-2)  is used, the contracting officer  shall  specify appropriate reporting

instructions in the Schedule (see 42.1106 (a)).

Subpart [42.12](/part-42/42.12)  - Novation and Change-of-Name Agreements

42.1200  Scope of subpart.

This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for-

(a) Recognition of a successor in interest to Government contracts when contractor assets are

transferred;

(b) Recognition of a change in a contractor’s name; and

(c) Execution of novation agreements  and change-of-name agreements  by the responsible

contracting officer .

42.1201  [Reserved]

42.1202  Responsibility for executing agreements.

The contracting officer  responsible for processing and executing novation and change-of-name

agreements  shall  be determined as follows:

(a) If any of the affected contracts held by the transferor have been assigned to an administrative

contracting officer  (ACO) (see [2.1](/part-2/2.1) and [42.202](/part-42/42.202) ), the responsible contracting officer  shall  be-

(1) This ACO; or

(2) The ACO responsible for the corporate office, if affected contracts are in more than one plant or

division of the transferor.

(b) If none of the affected contracts held by the transferor have been assigned to an ACO, the

contracting officer  responsible for the largest unsettled (unbilled plus billed but unpaid) dollar

balance of contracts shall  be the responsible contracting officer .

(c) If several transferors are involved, the responsible contracting officer  shall  be-

(1) The ACO administering the largest unsettled dollar balance; or

(2) The contracting officer  (or ACO) designated by the agency having the largest unsettled dollar

balance, if none of the affected contracts have been assigned to an ACO.

42.1203  Processing agreements.

(a) If a contractor wishes the Government to recognize a successor in interest to its contracts or a

name change, the contractor must  submit a written request to the responsible contracting officer

(see 42.1202 ). If the contractor received its contract under subpart  [8.7](/part-8/8.7)  under 41 U.S.C. chapter 85,

Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled, use the procedures at

[8.716](/part-8/8.716)  instead.

(b) The responsible contracting officer  shall -

(1) Identify and request that the contractor submit the information necessary to evaluate the

proposed agreement for recognizing a successor in interest or a name change. This information

should  include the items identified in 42.1204 (e) and (f) or 42.1205 (a), as applicable;

(2) Notify each contract administration office  and contracting office  affected by a proposed

agreement for recognizing a successor in interest, and provide those offices with a list of all affected

contracts; and

(3) Request submission of any comments or objections to the proposed transfer within 30 days after

notification. Any submission should  be accompanied by supporting documentation.

(c) Upon receipt of the necessary information, the responsible contracting officer  shall  determine

whether or not it is in the Government’s interest to recognize the proposed successor in interest on

the basis of-

(1) The comments received from the affected contract administration offices  and contracting offices ;

(2) The proposed successor’s responsibility under subpart  [9.1](/part-9/9.1) , Responsible Prospective Contractors ;

and

(3) Any factor relating to the proposed successor’s performance of contracts with the Government

that the Government determines would impair the proposed successor’s ability to perform the

contract satisfactorily.

(d) The execution of a novation agreement  does not preclude the use of any other method available

to the contracting officer  to resolve any other issues related to a transfer of contractor assets,

including the treatment of costs.

(e) Any separate agreement between the transferor and transferee regarding the assumption of

liabilities ( e.g., long-term incentive compensation plans, cost accounting standards noncompliances,

environmental cleanup costs, and final overhead costs) should  be referenced specifically in the

novation agreement .

(f) Before novation and change-of-name agreements  are executed, the responsible contracting

officer  shall  ensure that Government counsel has reviewed them for legal sufficiency.

(g) The responsible contracting officer  shall -

(1) Forward a signed copy of the executed novation or change-of-name agreement  to the transferor

and to the transferee; and

(2) Retain a signed copy in the case file.

(h) Following distribution of the agreement, the responsible contracting officer  shall -

(1) Prepare a Standard Form 30 , Amendment of Solicitation /Modification of Contract, incorporating

a summary of the agreement and attaching a complete list of contracts affected;

(2) Retain the original Standard Form 30  with the attached list in the case file;

(3) Send a signed copy of the Standard Form 30 , with attached list to the transferor and to the

transferee; and

(4) Send a copy of this Standard Form 30  with attached list to each contract administration office  or

contracting office  involved, which shall  be responsible for further appropriate distribution.

42.1204  Applicability of novation agreements.

(a) 41 U.S.C.6305  prohibits transfer of Government contracts from the contractor to a third party.

The Government may, when in its interest, recognize a third party as the successor in interest to a

Government contract when the third party’s interest in the contract arises out of the transfer of-

(1) All the contractor’s assets; or

(2) The entire portion of the assets involved in performing the contract. (See [14.404-2](/part-14/14.404-2) (l) for the

effect of novation agreements  after bid opening but before award.) Examples of such transactions

include, but are not limited to-

(i) Sale of these assets with a provision for assuming liabilities;

(ii) Transfer of these assets incident to a merger or corporate consolidation; and

(iii) Incorporation of a proprietorship or partnership, or formation of a partnership.

(b) A novation agreement  is unnecessary when there is a change in the ownership of a contractor as

a result of a stock purchase, with no legal change in the contracting  party, and when that

contracting  party remains in control of the assets and is the party performing the contract. However,

whether there is a purchase of assets or a stock purchase, there may be issues related to the change

in ownership that appropriately should  be addressed in a formal agreement between the contractor

and the Government (see 42.1203 (e)).

(c) When it is in the Government’s interest not to concur in the transfer of a contract from one

company to another company, the original contractor remains under contractual obligation to the

Government, and the contract may be terminated for reasons of default, should  the original

contractor not perform.

(d) When considering whether to recognize a third party as a successor in interest to Government

contracts, the responsible contracting officer  shall  identify and evaluate any significant

organizational conflicts of interest in accordance with subpart  [9.5](/part-9/9.5) . If the responsible contracting

officer  determines that a conflict of interest cannot be resolved, but that it is in the best interest of

the Government to approve the novation request, a request for a waiver may be submitted in

accordance with the procedures at [9.503](/part-9/9.503) .

(e) When a contractor asks the Government to recognize a successor in interest, the contractor shall

submit to the responsible contracting officer  three signed copies of the proposed novation

agreement  and one copy each, as applicable, of the following:

(1) The document describing the proposed transaction, e.g., purchase/sale agreement or

memorandum of understanding.

(2) A list of all affected contracts between the transferor and the Government, as of the date of sale

or transfer of assets, showing for each, as of that date, the-

(i) Contract number and type;

(ii) Name and address of the contracting office ;

(iii) Total dollar value, as amended; and

(iv) Approximate remaining unpaid balance.

(3) Evidence of the transferee’s capability to perform.

(4) Any other relevant information requested by the responsible contracting officer .

(f) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, the contractor shall  submit to the responsible

contracting officer  one copy of each of the following documents, as applicable, as the documents

become available:

(1) An authenticated copy of the instrument effecting the transfer of assets; e.g., bill of sale,

certificate of merger, contract, deed, agreement, or court decree.

(2) A certified copy of each resolution of the corporate parties’ boards of directors authorizing the

transfer of assets.

(3) A certified copy of the minutes of each corporate party’s stockholder meeting necessary to

approve the transfer of assets.

(4) An authenticated copy of the transferee’s certificate and articles of incorporation, if a

corporation was formed for the purpose of receiving the assets involved in performing the

Government contracts.

(5) The opinion of legal counsel for the transferor and transferee stating that the transfer was

properly effected under applicable law and the effective date of transfer.

(6) Balance sheets of the transferor and transferee as of the dates immediately before and after the

transfer of assets, audited by independent accountants.

(7) Evidence that any security clearance requirements have been met.

(8) The consent of sureties  on all contracts listed under paragraph (e)(2) of this section if bonds are

required, or a statement from the transferor that none are required.

(g) If the Government has acquired the documents during its participation in the pre-merger or pre-

acquisition  review process, or the Government’s interests are adequately protected with an

alternative formulation of the information, the responsible contracting officer  may modify the list of

documents to be submitted by the contractor.

(h) When recognizing a successor in interest to a Government contract is consistent with the

Government’s interest, the responsible contracting officer  shall  execute a novation agreement  with

the transferor and the transferee. It shall  ordinarily provide in part that-

(1) The transferee assumes all the transferor’s obligations under the contract;

(2) The transferor waives all rights under the contract against the Government;

(3) The transferor guarantees performance of the contract by the transferee (a satisfactory

performance bond may be accepted instead of the guarantee); and

(4) Nothing in the agreement shall  relieve the transferor or transferee from compliance with any

Federal law.

(i) The responsible contracting officer  shall  use the following format for agreements when the

transferor and transferee are corporations and all the transferor’s assets are transferred. This

format may be adapted to fit specific cases and may be used as a guide in preparing similar

agreements for other situations.

Following the effective date of this Agreement, the term "Contractor," as used in the contracts, shall

complete discharge of the Government’s obligations under the contracts, to the extent of the

amounts paid or reimbursed.

(7) The Transferor and the Transferee agree that the Government is not obligated to pay or

reimburse either of them for, or otherwise give effect to, any costs, taxes, or other expenses, or any

Subpart [42.13](/part-42/42.13)  - Suspension of Work, Stop-Work Orders, and

Government Delay of Work

42.1301  General.

Situations may occur during contract performance that cause the Government to order a suspension

of work, or a work stoppage. This subpart provides clauses to meet these situations and a clause for

settling contractor claims  for unordered Government caused delays that are not otherwise covered

in the contract.

42.1302  Suspension of work.

A suspension  of work under a construction  or architect-engineer contract may be ordered by the

contracting officer  for a reasonable period of time. If the suspension  is unreasonable, the contractor

may submit a written claim  for increases in the cost of performance, excluding profit.

42.1303  Stop-work orders.

(a) Stop-work orders may be used, when appropriate, in any negotiated fixed-price or cost-

reimbursement supply, research and development, or service contract if work stoppage may be

required for reasons such as advancement in the state-of-the-art, production or engineering

breakthroughs, or realignment of programs.

(b) Generally, a stop-work order will be issued only if it is advisable to suspend work pending a

decision by the Government and a supplemental agreement  providing for the suspension  is not

feasible. Issuance of a stop-work order shall  be approved at a level higher than the contracting

officer . Stop-work orders shall  not be used in place of a termination notice after a decision to

terminate has been made.

(c) Stop-work orders should  include-

(1) A description of the work to be suspended;

(2) Instructions concerning the contractor’s issuance of further orders for materials or services;

(3) Guidance to the contractor on action to be taken on any subcontracts; and

(4) Other suggestions to the contractor for minimizing costs.

(d) Promptly after issuing the stop-work order, the contracting officer  should  discuss the stop-work

order with the contractor and modify the order, if necessary, in light of the discussion.

(e) As soon as feasible after a stop-work order is issued, but before its expiration, the contracting

officer  shall  take appropriate action to-

(1) Terminate the contract;

(2) Cancel the stop-work order (any cancellation of a stop-work order shall  be subject to the same

approvals as were required for its issuance); or

(3) Extend the period of the stop-work order if it is necessary and if the contractor agrees (any

extension of the stop-work order shall  be by a supplemental agreement ).

42.1304  Government delay of work.

(a) The clause at [52.242-17](/part-52/52.242-17) , Government Delay of Work, provides for the administrative settlement

of contractor claims  that arise from delays and interruptions in the contract work caused by the acts,

or failures to act, of the contracting officer . This clause is not applicable if the contract otherwise

specifically provides for an equitable adjustment because of the delay or interruption; e.g., when the

Changes clause is applicable.

(b) The clause does not authorize the contracting officer  to order a suspension , delay, or interruption

of the contract work and it shall  not be used as the basis or justification of such an order.

(c) If the contracting officer  has notice of an unordered delay or interruption covered by the clause,

the contracting officer  shall  act to end the delay or take other appropriate action as soon as

practicable.

(d) The contracting officer  shall  retain in the file a record of all negotiations leading to any

adjustment made under the clause, and related certified cost or pricing data , or data other than

certified cost or pricing data .

42.1305  Contract clauses.

(a) The contracting officer  shall  insert the clause at [52.242-14](/part-52/52.242-14) , Suspension  of Work, in solicitations

and contracts when a fixed-price construction  or architect-engineer contract is contemplated.

(b)

(1) The contracting officer  may, when contracting  by negotiation, insert the clause at [52.242-15](/part-52/52.242-15) ,

Stop-Work Order, in solicitations  and contracts for supplies , services, or research and development.

(2) If a cost-reimbursement contract is contemplated, the contracting officer  shall  use the clause

with its AlternateI.

(c) The contracting officer  shall  insert the clause at [52.242-17](/part-52/52.242-17) , Government Delay of Work, in

solicitations  and contracts when a fixed-price contract is contemplated for supplies  other than

commercial or modified- commercial products . The clause use is optional when a fixed-price contract

is contemplated for services, or for supplies  that are commercial or modified- commercial products .

Subpart [42.14](/part-42/42.14)  - [Reserved]

Subpart [42.15](/part-42/42.15)  - Contractor Performance Information

42.1500  Scope of subpart.

This subpart provides policies and establishes responsibilities for recording and maintaining

contractor performance information. This subpart does not apply to procedures used by agencies in

determining fees under award or incentive fee contracts. See subpart [16.4](/part-16/16.4). However, the fee amount

paid to contractors should  be reflective of the contractor’s performance and the past performance

evaluation should  closely parallel and be consistent with the fee determinations.

42.1501  General.

(a) Past performance  information (including the ratings and supporting narratives) is relevant

information, for future source selection purposes, regarding a contractor’s actions under previously

awarded contracts or orders. It includes, for example, the contractor’s record of-

(1) Conforming to requirements and to standards of good workmanship;

(2) Forecasting and controlling costs;

(3) Adherence to schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance;

(4) Reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction;

(5) Complying with the requirements of the small business subcontracting plan (see [19.705-7](/part-19/19.705-7) (b)),

including favorable consideration of a mentor with an SBA-approved mentor-protégé agreement (see

13 CFR 125.9 ) that subcontracts to its protégé, and that protégé is a covered territory business or

that protégé's principal office is located in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (see 15 U.S.C.

657r(a) );

(6) Reporting into databases (see subpart [4.14](/part-4/4.14), and reporting requirements in the solicitation

provisions and clauses referenced in [9.104-7](/part-9/9.104-7) );

(7) Integrity and business ethics; and

(8) Business-like concern for the interest of the customer.

(b) Agencies shall  monitor their compliance with the past performance  evaluation requirements (see

42.1502 ), and use the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) metric tools

to measure the quality and timely reporting of past performance  information. CPARS is the official

source for past performance  information.

42.1502  Policy.

(a) General. Past performance  evaluations shall  be prepared at least annually and at the time the

work under a contract or order is completed. Past performance  evaluations are required for

contracts and orders as specified in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section, including contracts

and orders performed outside the United States . These evaluations are generally for the entity,

division, or unit that performed the contract or order. Past performance  information shall  be entered

into CPARS, the Governmentwide evaluation reporting tool for all past performance  reports on

contracts and orders. Instructions for submitting evaluations into CPARS are available at

http://www.cpars.gov/ .

(b) Contracts. Except as provided in paragraphs (e), (f), and (h) of this section, agencies shall

prepare evaluations of contractor performance for each contract (as defined in FAR part  2 ) that

exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold  and for each order that exceeds the simplified

acquisition threshold . Agencies are required to prepare an evaluation if a modification to the

contract causes the dollar amount to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold .

(c) Orders under multiple-agency contracts. Agencies shall  prepare an evaluation of contractor

performance for each order that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold  that is placed under a

Federal Supply Schedule contract or placed under a task-order contract or a delivery-order contract

awarded by another agency ( i.e., Governmentwide acquisition contract  or multi-agency contract ).

Agencies placing orders under their own multiple-agency contract shall  also prepare evaluations for

their own orders. This evaluation shall  not consider the requirements under paragraph (g) of this

section. Agencies are required to prepare an evaluation if a modification to the order causes the

dollar amount to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold .

(d) Orders under single-agency contracts. For single-agency task-order and delivery-order contracts,

the contracting officer  may require performance evaluations for each order in excess of the

simplified acquisition threshold  when such evaluations would produce more useful past performance

information for source selection officials than that contained in the overall contract evaluation (e.g.,

when the scope of the basic contract is very broad and the nature of individual orders could be

significantly different). This evaluation need not consider the requirements under paragraph (g) of

this section unless the contracting officer  deems it appropriate.

(e) Past performance  evaluations shall  be prepared for each construction  contract of $900,000  or

more, and for each construction  contract terminated for default regardless of contract value. Past

performance  evaluations may also be prepared for construction  contracts below $900,000 .

(f) Past performance  evaluations shall  be prepared for each architect-engineer services  contract of

$45,000  or more, and for each architect-engineer services  contract that is terminated for default

regardless of contract value. Past performance  evaluations may also be prepared for architect-

engineer services  contracts below $45,000 .

(g) Past performance  evaluations shall  include an assessment of the contractor's-

(1) Performance against, and efforts to achieve, the goals identified in the small business

subcontracting plan when the contract includes the clause at [52.219-9](/part-52/52.219-9) , Small Business

Subcontracting Plan; and

(2) Reduced or untimely payments (as defined in [19.701](/part-19/19.701) ), made to small business subcontractors ,

determined by the contracting officer  to be unjustified. The contracting officer  shall -

(i) Consider and evaluate a contractor's written explanation for a reduced or an untimely payment

when determining whether the reduced or untimely payment is justified; and

(ii) Determine that a history of unjustified reduced or untimely payments has occurred when the

contractor has reported three or more occasions of unjustified reduced or untimely payments under

a single contract within a 12-month period (see 42.1503 (h)(1)(vi) and the evaluation ratings in Table

42-2). The following payment or nonpayment situations are not considered to be unjustified:

(A) There is a contract dispute on performance.

(B) A partial payment is made for amounts not in dispute.

(C) A payment is reduced due to past overpayments.

(D) There is an administrative mistake.

(E) Late performance by the subcontractor leads to later payment by the prime contractor.

(h) Agencies shall  not evaluate performance for contracts awarded under subpart  [8.7](/part-8/8.7) .

(i) Agencies shall  promptly report other contractor information in accordance with 42.1503 (h).

42.1503  Procedures.

(a)

(1) Agencies shall  assign responsibility and management accountability for the completeness of past

performance  submissions. Agency procedures for the past performance  evaluation system shall -

(i) Generally provide for input to the evaluations from the technical office, contracting office ,

program management office, and where appropriate, quality assurance and end users of the product

or service;

(ii) Identify and assign past performance  evaluation roles and responsibilities to those individuals

responsible for preparing and reviewing interim evaluations, if prepared, and final evaluations ( e.g.,

contracting officers , contracting officer  representatives, project managers, and program managers).

Those individuals identified may obtain information for the evaluation of performance from the

program office, administrative contracting office , audit office, end users of the product or service,

and any other technical or business advisor, as appropriate; and

(iii) Address management controls and appropriate management reviews of past performance

evaluations, to include accountability for documenting past performance  on CPARS.

(2) If agency procedures do not specify the individuals responsible for past performance  evaluation

duties, the contracting officer  is responsible for this function.

(3) Interim evaluations may be prepared as required, in accordance with agency procedures.

(b)

(1) The evaluation should  include a clear, non-technical description of the principal purpose of the

contract or order. The evaluation should  reflect how the contractor performed. The evaluation

should  include clear relevant information that accurately depicts the contractor’s performance, and

be based on objective facts supported by program and contract or order performance data. The

evaluations should  be tailored to the contract type, size, content, and complexity of the contractual

requirements.

(2) Evaluation factors for each assessment shall  include, at a minimum, the following:

(i) Technical (quality of product or service).

(ii) Cost control (not applicable for firm-fixed-price or fixed-price with economic price adjustment

arrangements).

(iii) Schedule/timeliness.

(iv) Management or business relations.

(v) Small business subcontracting, including reduced or untimely payments to small business

subcontractors  when [19.702](/part-19/19.702) (a) requires a subcontracting plan (as applicable, see Table  42-2 ).

(vi) Other (as applicable) (e.g., trafficking violations, tax delinquency, failure to report in accordance

with contract terms and conditions, defective cost or pricing data , terminations, suspension  and

debarments , and failure to comply with limitations on subcontracting).

(3) Evaluation factors may include subfactors.

(4) Each factor and subfactor used shall  be evaluated and a supporting narrative provided. Each

evaluation factor, as listed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, shall  be rated in accordance with a

five scale rating system ( i.e., exceptional, very good, satisfactory, marginal, and unsatisfactory). The

ratings and narratives must  reflect the definitions in the tables Table  42-1  or Table  42-2  of this

section.

(c)

(1) When the contract provides for incentive fees, the incentive-fee contract performance evaluation

shall  be entered into CPARS.

(2) When the contract provides for award fee, the award fee-contract performance adjectival rating

as described in [16.401](/part-16/16.401) (e)(3) shall  be entered into CPARS.

(d) Agency evaluations of contractor performance, including both negative and positive evaluations,

prepared under this subpart shall  be provided to the contractor as soon as practicable after

completion of the evaluation. The contractor will receive a CPARS-system generated notification

when an evaluation is ready for comment. Contractors shall  be afforded up to 14 calendar days from

the date of notification of availability of the past performance  evaluation to submit comments,

rebutting statements, or additional information. Agencies shall  provide for review at a level above

the contracting officer  to consider disagreements between the parties regarding the evaluation. The

ultimate conclusion on the performance evaluation is a decision of the contracting  agency. Copies of

the evaluation, contractor response, and review comments, if any, shall  be retained as part of the

evaluation. These evaluations may be used to support future award decisions, and should  therefore

be marked " Source Selection Information ". Evaluation of Federal Prison Industries (FPI)

performance may be used to support a waiver request (see [8.604](/part-8/8.604) ) when FPI is a mandatory source in

accordance with subpart  [8.6](/part-8/8.6) . The completed evaluation shall  not be released to other than

Government personnel and the contractor whose performance is being evaluated during the period

the information may be used to provide source selection information . Disclosure of such information

could cause harm both to the commercial interest of the Government and to the competitive position

of the contractor being evaluated as well as impede the efficiency of Government operations.

Evaluations used in determining award or incentive fee payments may also be used to satisfy the

requirements of this subpart. A copy of the annual or final past performance  evaluation shall  be

provided to the contractor as soon as it is finalized.

(e) Agencies shall  require frequent evaluation ( e.g., monthly, quarterly) of agency compliance with

the reporting requirements in 42.1502 , so agencies can readily identify delinquent past performance

reports and monitor their reports for quality control.

(f) Agencies shall  prepare and submit all past performance  evaluations electronically in CPARS at

https://www.cpars.gov . These evaluations, including any contractor-submitted information (with

indication whether agency review is pending), become available for source selection officials not

later than 14 days after the date on which the contractor is notified of the evaluation's availability

for comment. The Government shall  update CPARS with any contractor comments provided after 14

days, as well as any subsequent agency review of comments received. Past performance  evaluations

for classified contracts  and special access programs shall  not be reported in CPARS, but will be

reported as stated in this subpart and in accordance with agency procedures. Agencies shall  ensure

that appropriate management and technical controls are in place to ensure that only authorized

personnel have access to the data and the information safeguarded in accordance with 42.1503 (d).

(g) Agencies shall  use the past performance  information in CPARS. that is within three years (six for

construction  and architect-engineer contracts) of the completion of performance of the evaluated

contract or order, and information contained in the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity

Information System (FAPIIS), e.g., terminations for default or cause.

(h) Other contractor performance information.

(1) Agencies shall  ensure information is accurately reported in the FAPIIS module of CPARS within 3

calendar days after a contracting officer -

(i) Issues a final determination that a contractor has submitted defective cost or pricing data ;

(ii) Makes a subsequent change to the final determination concerning defective cost or pricing data

pursuant to [15.407-1](/part-15/15.407-1) (d);

(iii) Issues a final termination for cause or default notice;

(iv) Makes a subsequent withdrawal or a conversion of a termination for default  to a termination for

convenience ;

(v) Receives a final determination after an administrative proceeding, in accordance with

22.1704 (d)(1), that substantiates an allegation of a violation of the trafficking in persons prohibitions

in 22.1703 (a) and [52.222-50](/part-52/52.222-50) (b); or

(vi) Determines that a contractor has a history of three or more unjustified reduced or untimely

payments to small business subcontractors  under a single contract within a 12-month period (see

42.1502 (g)(2)).

(2) The information to be posted in accordance with this paragraph (h) is information relating to

contractor performance, but does not constitute a " past performance  review," which would be

exempted from public availability in accordance with section 3010 of the Supplemental

Appropriations Act, 2010 (Pub. L. 111-212). Therefore, all such information posted in FAPIIS will be

publicly available, unless covered by a disclosure exemption under the Freedom of Information Act

(see [9.105-2](/part-9/9.105-2) (b)(2)).

(3) Agencies shall  establish CPARS focal points who will register users to report data into the FAPIIS

module of CPARS (available at https://www.cpars.gov/ ).

(4) With regard to information that may be covered by a disclosure exemption under the Freedom of

Information Act, the contracting officer  shall  follow the procedures at [9.105-2](/part-9/9.105-2) (b)(2)(iv).

Table 42-1 -Evaluation Rating Definitions

Rating Definition Note

(a) ExceptionalPerformance meets contractual

requirements and exceeds many

to the Government’s benefit.

The contractual performance of

the element or sub-element

being evaluated was

accomplished with few minor

problems for which corrective

actions taken by the contractor

were highly effective.To justify an Exceptional rating,

identify multiple significant events

and state how they were of benefit to

the Government. A singular benefit,

however, could be of such magnitude

that it alone constitutes an

Exceptional rating. Also, there should

have been NO significant weaknesses

identified.

Rating Definition Note

(b) Very GoodPerformance meets contractual

requirements and exceeds some

to the Government’s benefit.

The contractual performance of

the element or sub-element

being evaluated was

accomplished with some minor

problems for which corrective

actions taken by the contractor

were effective.To justify a Very Good rating, identify

a significant event and state how it

was a benefit to the Government.

There should  have been no significant

weaknesses identified.

(c) SatisfactoryPerformance meets contractual

requirements. The contractual

performance of the element or

sub-element contains some

minor problems for which

corrective actions taken by the

contractor appear or were

satisfactory.To justify a Satisfactory rating, there

should  have been only minor

problems, or major problems the

contractor recovered from without

impact to the contract/order. There

should  have been NO significant

weaknesses identified. A fundamental

principle of assigning ratings is that

contractors will not be evaluated with

a rating lower than Satisfactory solely

for not performing beyond the

requirements of the contract/order.

(d) MarginalPerformance does not meet

some contractual requirements.

The contractual performance of

the element or sub-element

being evaluated reflects a

serious problem for which the

contractor has not yet identified

corrective actions. The

contractor’s proposed actions

appear only marginally effective

or were not fully implemented.To justify Marginal performance,

identify a significant event in each

category that the contractor had

trouble overcoming and state how it

impacted the Government. A Marginal

rating should  be supported by

referencing the management tool that

notified the contractor of the

contractual deficiency (e.g.,

management, quality, safety, or

environmental deficiency report or

letter).

Rating Definition Note

(e)

UnsatisfactoryPerformance does not meet

most contractual requirements

and recovery is not likely in a

timely manner. The contractual

performance of the element or

sub-element contains a serious

problem(s) for which the

contractor’s corrective actions

appear or were ineffective.To justify an Unsatisfactory rating,

identify multiple significant events in

each category that the contractor had

trouble overcoming and state how it

impacted the Government. A singular

problem, however, could be of such

serious magnitude that it alone

constitutes an unsatisfactory rating.

An Unsatisfactory rating should  be

supported by referencing the

management tools used to notify the

contractor of the contractual

deficiencies (e.g., management,

quality, safety, or environmental

deficiency reports, or letters).

NOTE 1: Plus or minus signs may be used to indicate an improving (+) or worsening (-) trend

insufficient to change the evaluation status.

NOTE 2: N/A (not applicable) should  be used if the ratings are not going to be applied to a particular

area for evaluation.

manner. Failed to satisfy one or

more requirements of a corrective

action plan currently in place;

however, does show an interest in

bringing performance to a

demonstrated a commitment to

apply the necessary resources to

do so. Required a corrective

action plan. Did not have a history

of three or more unjustified

reduced or untimely payments to

small business subcontractors

within a 12-month period.To justify a Marginal rating, identify

a significant event that the

contractor had trouble overcoming

and how it impacted small business

utilization. A Marginal rating should

A singular problem, however, could

be of such serious magnitude that it

alone constitutes an Unsatisfactory

rating. An Unsatisfactory rating

should  be supported by referencing

the actions taken by the Government

NOTE 2: Generally, zero percent is not a goal unless the contracting officer  determined when

negotiating the subcontracting plan that no subcontracting opportunities exist in a particular socio-

economic category. In such cases, the contractor shall  be considered to have met the goal for any

socio-economic category where the goal negotiated in the plan was zero.

42.1601  General.

The contracting officer  shall  make every reasonable effort to respond in writing  within 30 days to

any written request to the contracting officer  from a small business concern with respect to a

contract administration matter. In the event the contracting officer  cannot respond to the request

within the 30- day period, the contracting officer  shall , within the period, transmit to the contractor a

written notification of the specific date the contracting officer  expects to respond. This provision

shall  not apply to a request for a contracting officer  decision under 41 U.S.C. chapter 71 , Contract

Disputes.

Subpart [42.17](/part-42/42.17)  - Forward Pricing Rate Agreements

42.1701  Procedures.

(a) Negotiation of forward pricing rate agreements  (FPRA’s) may be requested by the contracting

officer  or the contractor or initiated by the administrative contracting officer  (ACO). In determining

whether or not to establish such an agreement, the ACO should  consider whether the benefits to be

derived from the agreement are commensurate with the effort of establishing and monitoring it.

Normally, FPRA’s should  be negotiated only with contractors having a significant volume of

Government contract proposals. The cognizant contract administration agency shall  determine

whether an FPRA will be established.

(b) The ACO shall  obtain the contractor’s forward pricing  rate proposal and require that it include

cost or pricing data  that are accurate, complete, and current as of the date of submission (but see

[15.407-3](/part-15/15.407-3) (c)). The ACO shall  invite the cognizant contract auditor and contracting offices  having a

significant interest to participate in developing a Government objective and in the negotiations.

Upon completing negotiations, the ACO shall  prepare a price negotiation memorandum (PNM) (see

[15.406-3](/part-15/15.406-3) ) and forward copies of the PNM and FPRA to the cognizant auditor and to all contracting

offices  that are known to be affected by the FPRA.

(c) The FPRA shall  provide specific terms and conditions covering expiration, application, and data

requirements for systematic monitoring to ensure the validity of the rates. The agreement shall

provide for cancellation at the option  of either party and shall  require the contractor to submit to the

ACO and to the cognizant contract auditor any significant change in cost or pricing data  used to

support the FPRA.

(d) When an FPRA is invalid, the contractor should  submit and negotiate a new proposal to reflect

the changed conditions. If an FPRA has not been established or has been invalidated, the ACO will

issue a forward pricing rate recommendation  (FPRR) to buying activities with documentation to

assist negotiators. In the absence of an FPRA or FPRR, the ACO shall  include support for rates

utilized.

(e) The ACO may negotiate continuous updates to the FPRA. The FPRA will provide specific terms

and conditions covering notification, application, and data requirements for systematic monitoring to

ensure the validity of the rates.
