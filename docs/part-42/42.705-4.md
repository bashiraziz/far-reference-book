# 42.705-4 State and local governments

The OMB Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR part 200 , subpart E and appendix V, concerning cost

principles for state and local governments (see subpart  [31.6](/part-31/31.6) ) establishes the cognizant agency

concept and the procedures for determining a cognizant agency for approving State and local

government indirect costs  associated with federally-funded programs and activities. The indirect

cost rates  negotiated and approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs  will be used by all

Federal agencies  that also award contracts to these same State and local governments.
