The contracting officer shall make every reasonable effort to respond in writing within 30 days to any written request to the contracting officer from a small business concern with respect to a contract administration matter. In the event the contracting officer cannot respond to the request within the 30-day period, the contracting officer shall, within the period, transmit to the contractor a written notification of the specific date the contracting officer expects to respond. This provision shall not apply to a request for a contracting officer decision under 41 U.S.C. chapter 71, Contract Disputes.
