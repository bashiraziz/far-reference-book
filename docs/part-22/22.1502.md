# 22.1502 Policy.

Agencies must take appropriate action to enforce the laws prohibiting the manufacture or importation of products that have been mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part by forced or indentured child labor, consistent with 19 U.S.C.1307,29 U.S.C.201, etseq., and 41 U.S.C. chapter 65. Agencies should make every effort to avoid acquiring such products.
