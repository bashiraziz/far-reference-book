# 22.503 (b), providing a specific written explanation of why at least one of the following conditions

exists with respect to the particular contract:

(i) Requiring a project labor agreement  on the project would not advance the Federal Government's

interests in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement . The exception shall  be based

on one or more of the following factors:

(A) The project is of short duration and lacks operational complexity.

(B) The project will involve only one craft or trade.

(C) The project will involve specialized construction  work that is available from only a limited

number of contractors or subcontractors.

(D) The agency's need for the project is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that a project

labor agreement  would be impracticable.

(ii) Market research  indicates that requiring a project labor agreement  on the project would

substantially reduce the number of potential offerors  to such a degree that adequate competition at

a fair and reasonable price could not be achieved. (See 10.002 (b)(1) and 36.104 ). A likely reduction

in the number of potential offerors  is not, by itself, sufficient to except a contract from coverage

under this authority unless it is coupled with the finding that the reduction would not allow for

adequate competition at a fair and reasonable price.

(iii) Requiring a project labor agreement  on the project would otherwise be inconsistent with

Federal statutes, regulations, Executive orders, or Presidential memoranda.

(2) Considerations.  When determining whether the exception in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section

applies, contracting officers  shall  consider current market conditions and the extent to which price

fluctuations may be attributable to factors other than the requirement for a project labor agreement

( e.g., costs of labor or materials, supply chain costs). Agencies may rely on price analysis conducted

on recent competitive proposals for construction  projects of a similar size and scope.

(3) Timing of the exception  —

(i) Contracts other than IDIQ contracts.  The exception must  be granted for a particular contract by

the solicitation  date.

(ii) IDIQ contracts.  An exception shall  be granted prior to the solicitation  date if the basis for the

exception cited would apply to all orders. Otherwise, exceptions shall  be granted for each order by

the time of the notice of the intent to place an order ( e.g., 16.505 (b)(1)).
