# 22.103-2 Policy

Contractors  shall  perform all contracts, so far as practicable, without using overtime , particularly as

a regular employment practice, except when lower overall costs to the Government will result or

when it is necessary to meet urgent program needs. Any approved overtime , extra-pay shifts, and

multishifts should  be scheduled to achieve these objectives.
