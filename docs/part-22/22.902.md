Subpart [22.10](/part-22/22.10)  - Service Contract Labor Standards

22.1000  Scope of subpart.

This subpart prescribes policies and procedures implementing the provisions of 41 U.S.C. chapter

67, Service Contract  Labor Standards (formerly known as the Service Contract  Act of 1965), the

applicable provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended ( 29 U.S.C.201 , etseq. ),

and related Secretary of Labor regulations and instructions (29 CFR parts 4, 6, 8, and 1925).

22.1001  Definitions.

As used in this subpart-

Contractor  includes a subcontractor at any tier whose subcontract is subject to the provisions of the

statute.

Multiple year contracts  means contracts having a term of more than 1 year regardless of fiscal year

funding. The term includes multi year contracts (see [17.103](/part-17/17.103) ).

United States  means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana

Islands, American Samoa, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Johnston Island, Wake Island, and the outer

Continental Shelf as defined in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act ( 43 U.S.C.1331 , etseq .), but

does not include any other place subject to U.S. jurisdiction or any U.S. base or possession within a

foreign country (29 CFR [4.112](/part-4/4.112)).

Wage and Hour Division  means the unit in the Department of Labor to which is assigned functions of

the Secretary of Labor under the Service Contract  Labor Standards statute.

Wage determination  means a determination of minimum wages or fringe benefits made under 41

U.S.C.6703  or 6707(c) applicable to the employment in a given locality of one or more classes of

service employees .

22.1002  Statutory and Executive order requirements.

22.1002-1  General.

Service contracts  over $2,500 shall  contain mandatory provisions regarding minimum wages and

fringe benefits, safe and sanitary working conditions, notification to employees of the minimum

allowable compensation, and equivalent Federal employee classifications and wage rates. Under 41

U.S.C. 6707(d) , service contracts  may not exceed 5 years.

22.1002-2  Wage determinations based on prevailing rates.

Contractors  performing on service contracts  in excess of $2,500 to which no predecessor

contractor ’s collective bargaining agreement applies shall  pay their employees at least the wages

and fringe benefits found by the Department of Labor to prevail in the locality or, in the absence of a

wage determination , the minimum wage set forth in the Fair Labor Standards Act.

22.1002-3  Wage determinations based on collective bargaining agreements.

(a) Successor contractors  performing on contracts in excess of $2,500 for substantially the same

services performed in the same locality must  pay wages and fringe benefits (including accrued

wages and benefits and prospective increases) at least equal to those contained in any bona fide

collective bargaining agreement entered into under the predecessor contract. This requirement is

self-executing and is not contingent upon incorporating a wage determination  or the wage and

fringe benefit terms of the predecessor contractor ’s collective bargaining agreement in the

successor contract. This requirement will not apply if the Secretary of Labor determines-

(1) After a hearing, that the wages and fringe benefits are substantially at variance with those which

prevail for services of a similar character in the locality; or

(2) That the wages and fringe benefits are not the result of arm’s length negotiations.

(b) Paragraphs in this subpart  [22.10](/part-22/22.10)  which deal with this statutory requirement and the Department

of Labor’s implementing regulations are 22.1010 , concerning notification to contractors  and

bargaining representatives of procurement  dates; 22.1012-2 , explaining when a collective

bargaining agreement will not apply due to late receipt by the contracting officer ; and 22.1013  and

22.1021 , explaining when the application of a collective bargaining agreement can be challenged

due to a variance with prevailing rates or lack of arm’s length bargaining.

22.1002-4  Application of the Fair Labor Standards Act minimum wage.

No contractor  or subcontractor holding a service contract  for any dollar amount shall  pay any of its

employees working on the contract less than the minimum wage specified in section 6(a)(1) of the

Fair Labor Standards Act ( 29 U.S.C. 206 ).

22.1002-5  Executive Orders 13658 and 14026.

Executive Order (E.O.) 13658 established minimum wages for certain workers at $[10.10](/part-10/10.10) per hour.

The E.O. 13658 rate has increased each year since 2015, rising to $[11.25](/part-11/11.25) on January 1, 2022. As of

January 30, 2022, E.O. 13658 is superseded by E.O. 14026 to the extent that it is inconsistent with

E.O. 14026; the minimum wage rate for certain workers is increased to $[15.00](/part-15/15.00) per hour. The wage

rate is subject to annual increases by an amount determined by the Secretary of Labor. See subpart

[22.19](/part-22/22.19) . The clause at [52.222-55](/part-52/52.222-55) , Minimum Wages for Contractor  Workers under Executive Order

14026, requires the E.O. 14026 minimum wage rate to be paid if it is higher than other minimum

wage rates, such as the subpart  [22.10](/part-22/22.10)  statutory wage determination  amount.

22.1002-6  Executive Order 13706.

Executive Order 13706 establishes paid sick leave for employees of certain Federal contractors . See

subpart  [22.21](/part-22/22.21)  and the clause at [52.222-62](/part-52/52.222-62) , Paid Sick Leave under Executive Order 13706.

services in the United States  through the use of service employees , except as exempted in 22.1003-3

and 22.1003-4  of this section, or any subcontract at any tier thereunder. This subpart does not apply

to individual contract requirements for services in contracts not having as their principal purpose

the furnishing of services. The nomenclature, type, or particular form of contract used by

contracting  agencies is not determinative of coverage.

22.1003-2  Geographical coverage of the Act.

The Service Contract  Labor Standards statute applies to service contracts  performed in the United

States  (see 22.1001 ). The Service Contract  Labor Standards statute does not apply to contracts

performed outside the United States .

allowing reasonable variations, tolerances, and exemptions to and from any or all provisions of the

Service Contract  Labor Standards statute other than 41 U.S.C. 6707(f) . These will be made only in

special circumstances where it has been determined that the limitation, variation, tolerance, or

exemption is necessary and proper in the public interest or to avoid the serious impairment of

Government business, and is in accord with the remedial purpose of the Service Contract  Labor

Standards statute to protect prevailing labor standards ( 41 U.S.C. 6707(b) ). See 29 CFR [4.123](/part-4/4.123)  for a

listing of administrative exemptions, tolerances, and variations. Requests for limitations, variances,

Standards statute. Remanufacturing shall  be deemed to be manufacturing when the criteria in either

paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section are met.

(1) Major overhaul of an item, piece of equipment, or material which is degraded or inoperable, and

under which all of the following conditions exist:

(i) The item or equipment is required to be completely or substantially torn down into individual

component  parts.

(ii) Substantially all of the parts are reworked, rehabilitated, altered and/or replaced.

(iii) The parts are reassembled so as to furnish a totally rebuilt item or piece of equipment.

(iv) Manufacturing processes similar to those which were used in the manufacturing of the item or

piece of equipment are utilized.

(v) The disassembled components , if usable (except for situations where the number of items or

pieces of equipment involved are too few to make it practicable) are commingled with existing

inventory and, as such, lose their identification with respect to a particular piece of equipment.

(vi) The items or equipment overhauled are restored to original life expectancy, or nearly so.

(vii) Such work is performed in a facility owned or operated by the contractor .

(2) Major modification of an item, piece of equipment, or material which is wholly or partially

obsolete, and under which all of the following conditions exist:

(i) The item or equipment is required to be completely or substantially torn down.

(ii) Outmoded parts are replaced.

(iii) The item or equipment is rebuilt or reassembled.

(iv) The contract work results in the furnishing of a substantially modified item in a usable and

serviceable condition.

(v) The work is performed in a facility owned or operated by the contractor .

(b) Remanufacturing does not include the repair of damaged or broken equipment which does not

require a complete teardown, overhaul, and rebuild as described in subparagraphs(a)(1) and (a)(2)

of this subsection, or the periodic and routine maintenance, preservation, care, adjustment, upkeep,

or servicing of equipment to keep it in usable, serviceable, working order. Such contracts typically

are billed on an hourly rate (labor plus materials and parts) basis. Any contract principally for this

type of work is subject to the Service Contract  Labor Standards statute. Examples of such work

include the following:

(1) Repair of an automobile, truck, or other vehicle, construction  equipment, tractor, crane,

aerospace, air conditioning and refrigeration equipment, electric motors, and ground powered

industrial or vehicular equipment.

to an acquisition , the contracting officer  shall  request the advice of the agency labor advisor .

Unresolved questions shall  be submitted in a timely manner to the Administrator , Wage and Hour

Division , for determination.

Equipment-Requirements, or [52.222-53](/part-52/52.222-53) , Exemption from Application of the Service Contract  Labor

Standards to Contracts for Certain Services-Requirements, in the contract, in accordance with the

prescription at paragraph (e)(2)(ii) or (e)(4)(ii) of this subsection).

(b) The contracting officer  shall  insert the clause at [52.222-42](/part-52/52.222-42) , Statement of Equivalent Rates for

Federal Hires, in solicitations  and contracts if the contract amount is expected to be over $2,500 and

the Service Contract  Labor Standards statute is applicable. (See 22.1016 .)

(c)

(1) The contracting officer  shall  insert the clause at [52.222-43](/part-52/52.222-43) , Fair Labor Standards Act and Service

Contract  Labor Standards-Price Adjustment (Multiple Year and Option  Contracts), or another clause

which accomplishes the same purpose, in solicitations  and contracts if the contract is expected to be

a fixed-price, time-and-materials, or labor-hour service contract  containing the clause at [52.222-41](/part-52/52.222-41) ,

Service Contract  Labor Standards, and is a multiple year contract or is a contract with options  to

renew which exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold . The clause may be used in contracts that

do not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold . The clause at [52.222-43](/part-52/52.222-43) , Fair Labor Standards

Act and Service Contract  Labor Standards-Price Adjustment (Multiple Year and Option  Contracts),

applies to both contracts subject to area prevailing wage determinations  and contracts subject to the

incumbent contractor ’s collective bargaining agreement in effect during this contract’s preceding

contract period (see 22.1002-2  and 22.1002-3 ). Contracting officers  shall  ensure that contract prices

or contract unit price labor rates are adjusted only to the extent that a contractor ’s increases or

decreases in applicable wages and fringe benefits are made to comply with the requirements set

forth in the clauses at [52.222-43](/part-52/52.222-43)  (subparagraphs(d)(1), (2) and (3)), or [52.222-44](/part-52/52.222-44)

(subparagraphs(b)(1) and (2)). (For example, the prior year wage determination  required a minimum

wage rate of $[4.00](/part-4/4.00) per hour. The contractor  actually paid $[4.10](/part-4/4.10). The new wage determination

increases the minimum rate to $[4.50](/part-4/4.50). The contractor  increases the rate actually paid to $[4.75](/part-4/4.75) per

hour. The allowable price adjustment is $.40 per hour.)

(2) The contracting officer  shall  insert the clause at [52.222-44](/part-52/52.222-44) , Fair Labor Standards Act and Service

Contract  Labor Standards-Price Adjustment, in solicitations  and contracts if the contract is expected

to be a fixed-price, time-and-materials, or labor-hour service contract  containing the clause at

[52.222-41](/part-52/52.222-41) , Service Contract  Labor Standards, exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold , and is

not a multiple year contract or is not a contract with options  to renew. The clause may be used in

contracts that do not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold . The clause at [52.222-44](/part-52/52.222-44) , Fair

Labor Standards Act and Service Contract  Labor Standards-Price Adjustment, applies to both

contracts subject to area prevailing wage determinations  and contracts subject to contractor

collective bargaining agreements (see 22.1002-2  and 22.1002-3 ).

(3) The clauses prescribed in paragraph 22.1006 (c)(1) cover situations in which revised minimum

wage rates are applied to contracts by operation of law, or by revision of a wage determination  in

connection with (i) exercise of a contract option  or (ii) extension of a multiple year contract into a

new program year. If a clause prescribed in [16.203-4](/part-16/16.203-4) (d) is used, it must  not conflict with, or

duplicate payment under, the clauses prescribed in this paragraph 22.1006 (c).

(d) [Reserved]

(e)

(1) The contracting officer  shall  insert the provision at [52.222-48](/part-52/52.222-48) , Exemption from Application of the

Service Contract  Labor Standards to Contracts for Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain

Equipment-Certification, in solicitations  that-

(i) Include the clause at [52.222-41](/part-52/52.222-41) , Service Contract  Labor Standards; and

(ii) The contract may be exempt from the Service Contract  Labor Standards statute in accordance

with 22.1003-4 (c).

Equipment-Requirements-

(i) In solicitations  that include the provision at [52.222-48](/part-52/52.222-48) , or the comparable provision is checked as

applicable in the clause at [52.204-8](/part-52/52.204-8) (c)(2)(iii) or [52.212-3](/part-52/52.212-3) (k)(1); and

(ii) In resulting contracts in which the contracting officer  has determined, in accordance with

22.1003-4 (c)(3), that the Service Contract  Labor Standards statute does not apply.

(3)

(i) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, the contracting officer  shall  insert the

provision at [52.222-52](/part-52/52.222-52) , Exemption from Application of the Service Contract  Labor Standards to

Contracts for Certain Services--Certification, in solicitations  that-

(A) Include the clause at [52.222-41](/part-52/52.222-41) , Service Contract  Labor Standards, and

(B) The contract may be exempt from the Service Contract  Labor Standards statute in accordance

with 22.1003-4 (d).

(ii) When resoliciting in accordance with 22.1003-4 (d)(3)(iii), amend the solicitation  by removing the

provision at [52.222-52](/part-52/52.222-52)  from the solicitation .

(ii) In resulting contracts in which the contracting officer  has determined, in accordance with

22.1003-4 (d)(3), that the Service Contract  Labor Standards statute does not apply.

(f) The contracting officer  shall  insert the clause at [52.222-49](/part-52/52.222-49) , Service Contract  Labor Standards-

Place of Performance Unknown, if using the procedures prescribed in 22.1009-4 .

22.1007  Requirement to obtain wage determinations.

The contracting officer  shall  obtain wage determinations  for the following service contracts :

(a) Each new solicitation  and contract in excess of $2,500.

(b) Each contract modification  which brings the contract above $2,500 and-

(1) Extends the existing contract pursuant to an option  clause or otherwise; or

(2) Changes the scope of the contract whereby labor requirements are affected significantly.

(c) Each multiple year contract in excess of $2,500 upon-

(1) Annual anniversary date if the contract is subject to annual appropriations; or

(2) Biennial anniversary date if the contract is not subject to annual appropriations and its proposed

term exceeds 2 years-unless otherwise advised by the Wage and Hour Division .

22.1008  Procedures for obtaining wage determinations.

22.1008-1  Obtaining wage determinations.

(a) Contracting officers  may obtain most prevailing wage determinations  using the Wage

Determinations  at SAM.gov  website. Contracting officers  may also use the Department of Labor’s

e98 electronic process, located on the Wage Determinations  at SAM.gov  website, to request a wage

determination  directly from the Department of Labor. If the Wage Determinations  at SAM.gov

database does not contain the applicable prevailing wage determination  for a contract action, the

contracting officer  must  use the e98 process to request a wage determination  from the Department

of Labor.

(b) In using the e98 process to obtain prevailing wage determinations , contracting officers  shall

provide as complete and accurate information on the e98 as possible. Contracting officers  shall

ensure that the email address submitted on an e98 request is accurate.

(c) The contracting officer  must  anticipate the amount of time required to gather the information

necessary to obtain a wage determination , including sufficient time, if necessary, to contact the

Department of Labor to request wage determinations  that are not available through use of the Wage

Determinations  at SAM.gov  .

(d) Although the Wage Determinations  at SAM.gov  website provides assistance to the contracting

agency to select the correct wage determination , the contracting  agency remains responsible for the

wage determination  selected. If the contracting  agency has used the e98 process, the Department of

Labor will respond to the contracting  agency based on the information provided on the e98. The

contracting  agency may rely upon the Department of Labor response as the correct wage

determination  for the contract.

(e) To obtain the applicable wage determination  for each contract action, the contracting officer

shall  determine the following information concerning the service employees  expected to be

employed by the contractor  and any subcontractors in performing the contract:

(1) Determine the classes of service employees  to be utilized in performance of the contract using

the Wage and Hour Division ’s Service Contract  Act Directory of Occupations  (Directory). The

Directory can be found on Wage Determinations  at SAM.gov  Library Page, and is for sale by the

Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Publishing Office.

(2) Determine the locality where the services will be performed (see 22.1009 ).

(3) Determine whether 41 U.S.C. 6707(c)  applies (see 22.1008-2 , 22.1010  and 22.1002-2 ).

(4) Determine the wage rate that would be paid each class if employed by the agency and subject to

the wage provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5341  and/or 5332 (see 22.1016 ).

(f) If the contracting officer  has questions regarding the procedures for obtaining a wage

determination , or questions regarding the selection of a wage determination , the contracting officer

should  request assistance from the agency labor advisor .

22.1008-2  Successorship with incumbent contractor collective bargaining agreement.

(a) Early in the acquisition  cycle, the contracting officer  shall  determine whether 41 U.S.C. 6707(c)

affects the new acquisition . The contracting officer  shall  determine whether there is a predecessor

contract covered by the Service Contract  Labor Standards statute and, if so, whether the incumbent

prime contractor  or its subcontractors and any of their employees have a collective bargaining

agreement.

(b) 41 U.S.C. 6707(c)  provides that a successor contractor  must  pay wages and fringe benefits

(including accrued wages and benefits and prospective increases) to service employees  at least

equal to those agreed upon by a predecessor contractor  under the following conditions:

(1) The services to be furnished under the proposed contract will be substantially the same as

services being furnished by an incumbent contractor  whose contract the proposed contract will

succeed.

(2) The services will be performed in the same locality.

(3) The incumbent prime contractor  or subcontractor is furnishing such services through the use of

service employees  whose wages and fringe benefits are the subject of one or more collective

bargaining agreements.

(c) The application of 41 U.S.C. 6707(c)  is subject to the following limitations:

(1) 41 U.S.C. 6707(c)  will not apply if the incumbent contractor  enters into a collective bargaining

agreement for the first time and the agreement does not become effective until after the expiration

of the incumbent’s contract.

(2) If the incumbent contractor  enters into a new or revised collective bargaining agreement during

the period of the incumbent’s performance on the current contract, the terms of the new or revised

agreement shall  not be effective for the purposes of 41 U.S.C. 6707(c)  under the following

conditions:

(i)

(A) In sealed bidding, the contracting  agency receives notice of the terms of the collective

bargaining agreement less than 10 days before bid opening and finds that there is not reasonable

time still available to notify bidders (see 22.1012-2 (a)); or

(B) For contractual actions other than sealed bidding, the contracting  agency receives notice of the

terms of the collective bargaining agreement after award, provided that the start of performance is

within 30 days of award (see 22.1012-2 (b)); and

(ii) The contracting officer  has given both the incumbent contractor  and its employees’ collective

bargaining agent timely written notification of the applicable acquisition  dates (see 22.1010 ).

(d)

(1) If 41 U.S.C. 6707(c)  applies, the contracting officer  shall  obtain a copy of any collective

bargaining agreement between an incumbent contractor  or subcontractor and its employees.

Obtaining a copy of an incumbent contractor ’s collective bargaining agreement may involve

coordination with the administrative contracting officer  responsible for administering the

predecessor contract. (Paragraph (m) of the clause at [52.222-41](/part-52/52.222-41) , Service Contract  Labor Standards,

requires the incumbent prime contractor  to furnish the contracting officer  a copy of each collective

bargaining agreement.)

(2) If the contracting officer  has timely received the collective bargaining agreement, the

contracting officer  may use the Wage Determinations  at SAM.gov  website to prepare a wage

determination  referencing the agreement and incorporate that wage determination , attached to a

complete copy of the collective bargaining agreement, into the successor contract action. In using

the Wage Determinations  at SAM.gov  process, it is not necessary to submit a copy of the collective

bargaining agreement to the Department of Labor unless requested to do so.

(3) The contracting officer  may also use the e98 process on Wage Determinations  at SAM.gov  to

request that the Department of Labor prepare the cover wage determination . The Department of

Labor’s response to the e98 may include a request for the contracting officer  to submit a complete

copy of the collective bargaining agreement. Any questions regarding the applicability of the Service

Contract  Labor Standards statute to a collective bargaining agreement should  be directed to the

agency labor advisor .

(e)

(1) 41 U.S.C. 6707(c)  will not apply if the Secretary of Labor determines (i) after a hearing, that the

wages and fringe benefits in the predecessor contractor ’s collective bargaining agreement are

substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a similar character in the locality,

or (ii) that the wages and fringe benefits in the predecessor contractor ’s collective bargaining

agreement are not the result of arm’s length negotiations (see 22.1013  and 22.1021 ). The

Department of Labor (DOL) has concluded that contingent collective bargaining agreement

provisions that attempt to limit a contractor ’s obligations by means such as requiring issuance of a

wage determination  by the DOL, requiring inclusion of the wage determination  in the contract, or

requiring the Government to adequately reimburse the contractor , generally reflect a lack of arm’s

length negotiations.

(2) If the contracting officer ’s review (see 22.1013 ) indicates that monetary provisions of the

collective bargaining agreement may be substantially at variance or may not have been reached as a

result of arm’s length bargaining, the contracting officer  shall  immediately contact the agency labor

advisor  to consider if further action is warranted.

(f) If the services are being furnished at more than one location and the collectively bargained wage

rates and fringe benefits are different at different locations or do not apply to one or more locations,

the contracting officer  shall  identify the locations to which the agreements apply.

(g) If the collective bargaining agreement does not apply to all service employees  under the

contract, the contracting officer  shall  access Wage Determinations  at SAM.gov  to obtain the

prevailing wage determination  for those service employee  classifications that are not covered by the

collective bargaining agreement. The contracting officer  shall  separately list in the solicitation  and

contract the service employee  classifications-

(1) Subject to the collective bargaining agreement; and

(2) Not subject to any collective bargaining agreement.

22.1009  Place of performance unknown.

22.1009-1  General.

If the place of performance is unknown, the contracting officer  may use the procedures in this

section. The contracting officer  should  first attempt to identify the specific places or geographical

areas where the services might be performed (see 22.1009-2 ) and then may follow the procedures

either in 22.1009-3  or in 22.1009-4 .

22.1009-2  Attempt to identify possible places of performance.

The contracting officer  should  attempt to identify the specific places or geographical areas where

the services might be performed. The following may indicate possible places of performance:

(a) Locations of previous contractors  and their competitors.

(b) Databases available via the Internet for lists of prospective offerors  and contractors .

(c) Responses to a presolicitation notice (see [5.204](/part-5/5.204) ).

22.1009-3  All possible places of performance identified.

(a) If the contracting officer  can identify all the possible places or areas of performance (even

though the actual place of performance will not be known until the successful offeror  is chosen), the

contracting officer  shall  obtain a wage determination  for each locality where services may be

performed (see 22.1008 ).

(b) If the contracting officer  subsequently learns of any potential offerors  in previously unidentified

places before the closing date for submission of offers , the contracting officer  shall -

(1) Obtain wage determinations  for the additional places of performance and amend the solicitation

to include all wage determinations . If necessary, the contracting officer  shall  extend the time for

submission of final offers ; and

(2) Follow the procedures in 22.1009-4 .

22.1009-4  All possible places of performance not identified.

If the contracting officer  believes that there may be offerors  interested in performing in unidentified

places or areas, the contracting officer  may use the following procedures:

(a) Include the following information in the synopsis and solicitation :

(1) That the place of performance is unknown.

(2) The possible places or areas of performance that the contracting officer  has already identified.

(3) That the contracting officer  will obtain wage determinations  for additional possible places of

performance if asked to do so in writing .

(4) The time and date by which offerors  must  notify the contracting officer  of additional places of

performance.

(b) Include the information required by paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(4) of this section in the clause at

[52.222-49](/part-52/52.222-49) , Service Contract  Labor Standards–Place of Performance Unknown (see 22.1006 (f)). The

closing date for receipt of offerors ’ requests for wage determinations  for additional possible places

of performance should  allow reasonable time for potential offerors  to review the solicitation  and

determine their interest in competing. Generally, 10 to 15 days from the date of issuance of the

solicitation  may be considered a reasonable period of time.

(c) The procedures in [14.304](/part-14/14.304)  shall  apply to late receipt of offerors ’ requests for wage determinations

for additional places of performance. However, late receipt of an offeror ’s request for a wage

determination  for additional places of performance does not preclude the offeror ’s competing for the

proposed acquisition .

(d) If the contracting officer  receives any timely requests for wage determinations  for additional

places of performance the contracting officer  shall -

(1) Obtain wage determinations  for the additional places of performance; and

(2) Amend the solicitation  to include all wage determinations  and, if necessary, extend the time for

submission of final offers .

(e) If the successful offeror  did not make a timely request for a wage determination  and will perform

in a place of performance for which the contracting officer  therefore did not request a wage

determination , the contracting officer  shall -

(1) Award the contract;

(2) Obtain a wage determination ; and

(3) Incorporate the wage determination  in the contract, retroactive to the date of contract award and

with no adjustment in contract price, pursuant to the clause at [52.222-49](/part-52/52.222-49) , Service Contract  Labor

Standards–Place of Performance Unknown.

22.1010  Notification to interested parties under collective bargaining

agreements.

(a) The contracting officer  should  determine whether the incumbent prime contractor ’s or its

subcontractors’ service employees  performing on the current contract are represented by a

collective bargaining agent. If there is a collective bargaining agent, the contracting officer  shall

give both the incumbent contractor  and its employees’ collective bargaining agent written

notification of-

(1) The forthcoming successor contract and the applicable acquisition  dates (issuance of solicitation ,

opening of bids, commencement of negotiations, award of contract, or start of performance, as the

case may be); or

(2) The forthcoming contract modification  and applicable acquisition  dates (exercise of option ,

extension of contract, change in scope, or start of performance, as the case may be); or

(3) The forthcoming multiple year contract anniversary date (annual anniversary date or biennial

date, as the case may be).

(b) This written notification must  be given at least 30 days in advance of the earliest applicable

acquisition  date or the applicable annual or biennial anniversary date in order for the time-of-receipt

limitations in paragraphs 22.1012-2 (a) and (b) to apply. The contracting officer  shall  retain a copy of

the notification in the contract file.

22.1011  [Reserved]

22.1012  Applicability of revisions to wage determinations.

22.1012-1  Prevailing wage determinations.

(a)

(1) The Wage and Hour Administrator  may issue revisions to prevailing wage determinations

periodically. The need for inclusion of a revised prevailing wage determination  in a solicitation ,

contract or contract modification  (see 22.1007 ) is determined by the date of receipt of the revised

prevailing wage determination  by the contracting  agency. (Note the distinction between receipt by

the agency and receipt by the contracting officer  which may occur later.)

(i) For purposes of using Wage Determinations  at SAM.gov , the time of receipt by the contracting

agency shall  be the first day of publication of the revised prevailing wage determination  on the

website.

(ii) For purposes of using the e98 process, the time of receipt by the contracting  agency shall  be the

date the agency receives actual notice of a new or revised prevailing wage determination  from the

Department of Labor as an e98 response.

(2) In selecting a prevailing wage determination  from the Wage Determinations  at SAM.gov  website

for use in a solicitation  or other contract action, the contracting officer  shall  monitor the Wage

Determinations  at SAM.gov  website to determine whether the applicable wage determination  has

been revised. Revisions published on the Wage Determinations  at SAM.gov  website or otherwise

communicated to the contracting officer  within the timeframes prescribed at 22.1012-1 (b) and (c)

are effective and must  be included in the resulting contract. Monitoring can be accomplished by use

of the Wage Determinations  at SAM.gov  website’s "Alert Service".

(b) The following shall  apply when contracting  by sealed bidding: a revised prevailing wage

determination  shall  not be effective if it is received by the contracting  agency less than 10 days

before the opening of bids, and the contracting officer  finds that there is not reasonable time to

incorporate the revision in the solicitation .

(c) For contractual actions other than sealed bidding, a revised prevailing wage determination

received by the contracting  agency after award of a new contract or a modification as specified in

22.1007 (b) shall  not be effective provided that the start of performance is within 30 days of the

award or the specified modification. If the contract does not specify a start of performance date

which is within 30 days of the award or the specified modification, and if contract performance does

not commence within 30 days of the award or the specified modification, any revision received by

the contracting  agency not less than 10 days before commencement of the work shall  be effective.

(d) If the contracting officer  has submitted an e98 to the Department of Labor requesting a

prevailing wage determination  and has not received a response within 10 days, the contracting

officer  shall  contact the Wage and Hour Division  by telephone to determine when the wage

determination  can be expected. (The telephone number is provided on the e98 website.)

22.1012-2  Wage determinations based on collective bargaining agreements.

(a) In sealed bidding, a new or changed collective bargaining agreement shall  not be effective under

41 U.S.C. 6707(c)  if the contracting  agency has received notice of the terms of the new or changed

collective bargaining agreement less than 10 days before bid opening and the contracting officer

determines that there is not reasonable time to incorporate the new or changed terms of the

collective bargaining agreement in the solicitation .

(b) For contractual actions other than sealed bidding, a new or changed collective bargaining

agreement shall  not be effective under 41 U.S.C. 6707(c)  if notice of the terms of the new or

changed collective bargaining agreement is received by the contracting  agency after award of a

successor contract or a modification as specified in 22.1007 (b), provided that the contract start of

performance is within 30 days of the award of the contract or of the specified modification. If the

contract does not specify a start of performance date which is within 30 days of the award of the

contract or of the specified modification, or if contract performance does not commence within 30

days of the award of the contract or of the specified modification, any notice of the terms of a new or

changed collective bargaining agreement received by the agency not less than 10 days before

commencement of the work shall  be effective for purposes of the successor contract under 41 U.S.C.

6707(c) .

(c) The limitations in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection shall  apply only if timely notification

required in 22.1010  has been given.

(d) If the contracting officer  has submitted an e98 to Department of Labor requesting a wage

determination  based on a collective bargaining agreement and has not received a response from the

Department of Labor within 10 days, the contracting officer  shall  contact the Wage and Hour

Division  by telephone to determine when the wage determination  can be expected. (The telephone

number is provided on the e98 website.) If the Department of Labor is unable to provide the wage

determination  by the latest date needed to maintain the acquisition  schedule, the contracting officer

shall  incorporate the collective bargaining agreement itself in a solicitation  or other contract action

(e.g., exercise of option ) and include a wage determination  referencing that collective bargaining

agreement created by use of the Wage Determinations  at SAM.gov  website (see 22.1008-1 (d)(2)).

22.1013  Review of wage determination.

(a) Based on incumbent collective bargaining agreement.  (1)If wages, fringe benefits, or periodic

increases provided for in a collective bargaining agreement vary substantially from those prevailing

for similar services in the locality, the contracting officer  shall  immediately contact the agency labor

advisor  to consider instituting the procedures in 22.1021 .

(1) If the contracting officer  believes that an incumbent or predecessor contractor ’s agreement was

not the result of arm’s length negotiations, the contracting officer  shall  contact the agency labor

advisor  to determine appropriate action.

(b) Based on other than incumbent collective bargaining agreement.  Upon receiving a wage

determination  not predicated upon a collective bargaining agreement, the contracting officer  shall

ascertain-

(1) If the wage determination  does not conform with wages and fringe benefits prevailing for similar

services in the locality; or

(2) If the wage determination  contains significant errors or omissions. If either subparagraph (b)(1)

or (b)(2) of this section is evident, the contracting officer  shall  contact the agency labor advisor  to

determine appropriate action.

22.1014  Delay over 60 days in bid opening or commencement of work.

If a wage determination  was obtained through the e98 process, and bid opening, or commencement

of work under a negotiated contract has been delayed, for whatever reason, more than 60 days from

the date indicated on the previously submitted e98, the contracting officer  shall  submit a new e98.

Any revision of a wage determination  received by the contracting  agency as a result of that

communication shall  supersede the earlier response as the wage determination  applicable to the

particular acquisition  subject to the time frames in 22.1012-1 (b) and (c).

22.1015  Discovery of errors by the Department of Labor.

If the Department of Labor discovers and determines, whether before or after a contract award, that

a contracting officer  made an erroneous determination that the Service Contract  Labor Standards

statute did not apply to a particular acquisition  or failed to include an appropriate wage

determination  in a covered contract, the contracting officer , within 30 days of notification by the

Department of Labor, shall  include in the contract the clause at [52.222-41](/part-52/52.222-41)  and any applicable wage

determination  issued by the Administrator . If the contract is subject to 41 U.S.C. 6707(c) , the

Administrator  may require retroactive application of that wage determination . The contracting

officer  shall  equitably adjust the contract price to reflect any changed cost of performance resulting

from incorporating a wage determination  or revision.

22.1016  Statement of equivalent rates for Federal hires.

(a) The statement required under the clause at [52.222-42](/part-52/52.222-42) , Statement of Equivalent Rates for Federal

Hires, (see 22.1006 (b)) shall  set forth those wage rates and fringe benefits that would be paid by the

contracting activity  to the various classes of service employees  expected to be utilized under the

contract if 5 U.S.C.5332  (General Schedule-white collar) and/or 5 U.S.C.5341  (Wage Board-blue

collar) were applicable.

(b) Procedures for computation of these rates are as follows:

(1) Wages paid blue collar employees shall  be the basic hourly rate for each class. The rate shall  be

Wage Board pay schedule step two for nonsupervisory service employees  and step three for

supervisory service employees .

(2) Wages paid white collar employees shall  be an hourly rate for each class. The rate shall  be

obtained by dividing the general pay schedule step one biweekly rate by 80.

(3) Local civilian personnel offices can assist in determining and providing grade and salary data.

22.1017  [Reserved]

22.1018  Notification to contractors and employees.

The contracting officer  shall  take the following steps to ensure that service employees  are notified of

minimum wages and fringe benefits.

(a) As soon as possible after contract award, inform the contractor  of the labor standards

requirements of the contract relating to the Service Contract  Labor Standards statute and of the

contractor ’s responsibilities under these requirements, unless it is clear that the contractor  is fully

informed.

(b) At the time of award, furnish the contractor  Department of Labor Publication WH-1313, Notice to

Employees Working on Government Contracts, for posting at a prominent and accessible place at

the worksite before contract performance begins. The publication advises employees of the

compensation (wages and fringe benefits) required to be paid or furnished under the Service

Contract  Labor Standards statute and satisfies the notice requirements in paragraph (g) of the

clause at [52.222-41](/part-52/52.222-41) , Service Contract  Labor Standards.

(c) Attach any applicable wage determination  to Publication WH-1313.

22.1019  Additional classes of service employees.

(a) If the contracting officer  is aware that contract performance involves classes of service

employees  not included in the wage determination , the contracting officer  shall  require the

contractor  to classify the unlisted classes so as to provide a reasonable relationship ( i.e., appropriate

level of skill comparison) between the unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the

determination (see paragraph (c) of the clause at [52.222-41](/part-52/52.222-41) , Service Contract  Labor Standards). The

contractor  shall  initiate the conforming procedure before unlisted classes of employees perform

contract work. The contractor  shall  submit Standard Form (SF) 1444 , Request For Authorization of

Additional Classification and Rate. The contracting officer  shall  review the proposed classification

and rate and promptly submit the completed SF 1444  (which must  include information regarding the

agreement or disagreement of the employees’ representative or the employees themselves together

with the agency recommendation) and all other pertinent information to the Wage and Hour

Division . Within 30 days of receipt of the request, the Wage and Hour Division  will (1) approve,

modify, or disapprove the request when the parties are in agreement or (2) render a final

determination in the event of disagreement among the parties. If the Wage and Hour Division  will

require more than 30 days to take action, it will notify the contracting officer  within 30 days of

receipt of the request that additional time is necessary.

(b) Some wage determinations  will list a series of classes within a job classification family, for

example, Computer Operators, level I, II, and III, or Electronic Technicians, level I, II, and III, or

Clerk Typist, level I and II. Generally, level I is the lowest level. It is the entry level, and

establishment of a lower level through conformance is not permissible. Further, trainee

classifications may not be conformed. Helpers in skilled maintenance trades (for example,

electricians, machinists, and automobile mechanics) whose duties constitute, in fact, separate and

distinct jobs may also be used if listed on the wage determination , but may not be conformed.

Conformance may not be used to artificially split or subdivide classifications listed in the wage

determination . However, conforming procedures may be used if the work which an employee

performs under the contract is not within the scope of any classification listed on the wage

determination , regardless of job title. (See 29 CFR [4.152](/part-4/4.152) .)

(c) Subminimum rates for apprentices, student learners, and disabled workers are permissible in

accordance with paragraph (q) of the clause at [52.222-41](/part-52/52.222-41) , Service Contract  Labor Standards.

22.1020  Seniority lists.

If a contract is performed at a Federal facility where employees may be hired/retained by a

succeeding contractor , the incumbent prime contractor  is required to furnish a certified list of all

service employees  on the contractor ’s or subcontractor’s payroll during the last month of the

contract, together with anniversary dates of employment, to the contracting officer  no later than 10

days before contract completion. (See paragraph (n) of the clause at [52.222-41](/part-52/52.222-41) , Service Contract

Labor Standards.) At the commencement of the succeeding contract, the contracting officer  shall

provide a copy of the list to the successor contractor  for determining employee eligibility for

vacation or other fringe benefits which are based upon length of service, including service with

predecessor contractors  if such benefit is required by an applicable wage determination .

22.1021  Request for hearing.

(a) A contracting  agency or other interested party may request a hearing on an issue presented in

22.1013 (a). To obtain a hearing for the contracting  agency, the contracting officer  shall  submit a

written request through appropriate channels (ordinarily the agency labor advisor ) to—

Administrator , Wage and Hour Division

U.S. Department of Labor

Washington, DC 20210

(b) A request for a substantial variance hearing shall  include sufficient data to show that the rates at

issue vary substantially from those prevailing for similar services in the locality. The request shall

also include-

(1) The number of the wage determinations  at issue;

(2) The name of the contracting  agency whose contract is involved;

(3) A brief description of the services to be performed under the contract;

(4) The status of the procurement  and any estimated procurement  dates, such as bid opening,

contract award, and commencement date of the contract or its follow-up option  period;

(5) A statement of the applicant’s case, setting forth in detail the reasons why the applicant believes

that a substantial variance exists with respect to some or all of the wages and/or fringe benefits;

(6) Names and addresses (to the extent known) of interested parties; and

(7) Any other data required by the Administrator .

(c) A request for an arm’s length hearing shall  include-

(1) A statement of the applicant’s case, setting forth in detail the reasons why the applicant believes

that the wages and fringe benefits contained in the collective bargaining agreement were not

reached as a result of arm’s length negotiations;

(2) A statement regarding the status of the procurement  and any estimated procurement  dates, such

as bid opening, contract award, and commencement date of the contract or its follow-up option

period; and

(3) Names and addresses (to the extent known) of interested parties.

(d) Unless the Administrator  determines that extraordinary circumstances exist, the Administrator

will not consider requests for a hearing unless received as follows:

(1) For sealed bid contracts, more than 10 days before the award of the contract; or

(2) For negotiated contracts and for contracts with provisions exceeding the initial term by option ,

before the commencement date of the contract or the follow-up option  period.

22.1022  Withholding of contract payments.

Any violations of the clause at [52.222-41](/part-52/52.222-41) , Service Contract  Labor Standards, as amended, renders

the responsible contractor  liable for the amount of any deductions, rebates, refunds, or

underpayments (which includes nonpayment) of compensation due employees performing the

contract. The contracting officer  may withhold-or, upon written request of the Department of Labor

from a level no lower than that of Deputy Regional Administrator , Wage and Hour Division ,

Department of Labor, shall  withhold-the amount needed to pay such underpaid employees from

accrued payments due the contractor  on the contract, or on any other prime contract (whether

subject to the Service Contract  Labor Standards statute or not) with the contractor . The agency shall

place the amount withheld in a deposit fund. Such withheld funds shall  be transferred to the

Department of Labor for disbursement to the underpaid employees on order of the Secretary (or

authorized representatives), and Administrative Law Judge, or the Administrative Review Board. In

addition, the Department of Labor has given blanket approval to forward withheld funds pending

completion of an investigation or other administrative proceeding when disposition of withheld funds

remains the final action necessary to close out a contract.

22.1023  Termination for default.

As provided by the Service Contract  Labor Standards statute, any contractor  failure to comply with

the requirements of the contract clauses  related to the Service Contract  Labor Standards statute

may be grounds for termination for default  (see paragraph (k) of the clause at [52.222-41](/part-52/52.222-41) , Service

Contract  Labor Standards).

22.1024  Cooperation with the Department of Labor.

The contracting officer  shall  cooperate with Department of Labor representatives in the examination

of records, interviews with service employees , and all other aspects of investigations undertaken by

the Department. When asked, agencies shall  furnish the Wage and Hour Administrator  or a

designee, any available information on contractors , subcontractors, their contracts, and the nature

of the contract services. The contracting officer  shall  promptly refer, in writing  to the appropriate

regional office of the Department, apparent violations and complaints received. Employee

complaints shall  not be disclosed to the employer.

22.1025  Ineligibility of violators.

Persons or firms found to be in violation of the Service Contract  Labor Standards statute will have

an active exclusion record contained in the System for Award Management  (see [9.404](/part-9/9.404) ). No

Government contract may be awarded to any violator so listed because of a violation of the Service

Contract  Labor Standards statute, or to any firm, corporation, partnership, or association in which

the violator has a substantial interest, without the approval of the Secretary of Labor. This

prohibition against award to an ineligible  contractor  applies to both prime and subcontracts.

22.1026  Disputes concerning labor standards.

Disputes concerning labor standards requirements of the contract are handled under paragraph (t)

of the contract clause  at [52.222-41](/part-52/52.222-41) , Service Contract  Labor Standards, and not under the clause at

[52.233-1](/part-52/52.233-1) , Disputes.

Subpart [22.11](/part-22/22.11)  - Professional Employee Compensation

22.1101  Applicability.

The Service Contract  Act of 1965, now codified at 41 U.S.C. chapter 67 , Service Contract  Labor

Standards, was enacted to ensure that Government contractors compensate their blue-collar service

workers and some white-collar service workers fairly, but it does not cover bona fide executive,

administrative, or professional employees .

22.1102  Definition.

Professional employee , as used in this subpart, means any person meeting the definition of

"employee employed in a bona fide . . . professional capacity" given in 29 CFR541. The term

embraces members of those professions having a recognized status based upon acquiring

professional knowledge through prolonged study. Examples of these professions include

accountancy, actuarial computation, architecture, dentistry, engineering, law, medicine, nursing,

pharmacy, the sciences (such as biology, chemistry, and physics, and teaching). To be a professional

employee , a person must  not only be a professional but must  be involved essentially in discharging

professional duties.

22.1103  Policy, procedures, and solicitation provision.

All professional employees  shall  be compensated fairly and properly. Accordingly, the contracting

officer  shall  insert the provision at [52.222-46](/part-52/52.222-46) , Evaluation of Compensation for Professional

Employees , in solicitations  for negotiated contracts when the contract amount is expected to exceed

$900,000  and services are to be provided which will require meaningful numbers of professional

employees . This provision requires that offerors  submit for evaluation a total compensation plan

setting forth proposed salaries and fringe benefits for professional employees  working on the

contract. Supporting information will include data, such as recognized national and regional

compensation surveys and studies of professional, public and private organizations, used in

establishing the total compensation structure. Plans indicating unrealistically low professional

employee  compensation may be assessed adversely as one of the factors considered in making an

award.

chapter 65 . Agencies should  make every effort to avoid acquiring such products .

22.1503  Procedures for acquiring end products on the List of Products

Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor.

(a) When issuing a solicitation  for supplies  expected to exceed the micro-purchase threshold , the

contracting officer  must  check the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced

or Indentured Child Labor  (the List) ( www.dol.gov/ilab/ ) (see 22.1505 (a)). Appearance of a product

on the List is not a bar to purchase of any such product mined, produced, or manufactured in the

identified country, but rather is an alert that there is a reasonable basis to believe that such product

may have been mined, produced, or manufactured by forced or indentured child labor .

(b) The requirements of this subpart that result from the appearance of any end product  on the List

do not apply to a solicitation  or contract if the identified country of origin on the List is-

(1) Israel, and the anticipated value of the acquisition  is $50,000 or more (see [25.406](/part-25/25.406) );

(2) Mexico, and the anticipated value of the acquisition  is $102,280 or more (see subpart  [25.4](/part-25/25.4) ); or

the anticipated value of the acquisition  is $174,000 or more (see [25.402](/part-25/25.402) (b)).

(c) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, before the contracting officer  may make an

award for an end product  (regardless of country of origin) of a type identified by country of origin on

the List the offeror  must  certify that-

(1) It will not supply any end product  on the List that was mined, produced, or manufactured in a

country identified on the List for that product, as specified in the solicitation  by the contracting

officer  in the Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products ; or

(2)

(i) It has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor  was used to

mine, produce, or manufacture any end product  to be furnished under the contract that is on the List

and was mined, produced, or manufactured in a country identified on the List for that product; and

(ii) On the basis of those efforts, the offeror  is unaware of any such use of child labor.

(d) Absent any actual knowledge that the certification is false, the contracting officer  must  rely on

the offerors ’ certifications in making award decisions.

(e) Whenever a contracting officer  has reason to believe that forced or indentured child labor  was

used to mine, produce, or manufacture an end product  furnished pursuant to a contract awarded

subject to the certification required in paragraph (c) of this section, the contracting officer  must

refer the matter for investigation by the agency’s Inspector General, the Attorney General, or the

Secretary of the Treasury, whichever is determined appropriate in accordance with agency

procedures, except to the extent that the end product  is from the country listed in paragraph (b) of

this section, under a contract exceeding the applicable threshold.

(f) Proper certification will not prevent the head of an agency from imposing remedies in accordance

with section 22.1504 (a)(4) if it is later discovered that the contractor has furnished an end product

or component  that has in fact been mined, produced, or manufactured, wholly or in part, using

forced or indentured child labor .

22.1504  Violations and remedies.

(a) Violations.  The Government may impose remedies set forth in paragraph (b) of this section for

the following violations (note that the violations in paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section go

beyond violations of the requirements relating to certification of end products ) (see 22.1503 ):

processes.

(4) The contractor has furnished an end product  or component  mined, produced, or manufactured,

the allegations of a trafficking in persons violation are substantiated, the contracting officer  shall —

(1) Enter the violation in FAPIIS (see 42.1503 (h)); and

(2) Consider taking any of the remedies specified in paragraph (e) of the clause at [52.222-50](/part-52/52.222-50) ,

Combating Trafficking in Persons. These remedies are in addition to any other remedies available to

the United States  Government. When determining the appropriate remedies, the contracting officer

may consider the following factors:

(i) Mitigating factors. The contractor had a Trafficking in Persons compliance plan or awareness

program at the time of the violation, was in compliance with the plan at the time of the violation, and

has taken appropriate remedial actions for the violations, that may include reparation to victims for

such violations.

(ii) Aggravating factors. The contractor failed to abate an alleged violation or enforce the

requirements of a compliance plan, when directed by a contracting officer  to do so.

22.1705  Solicitation provision and contract clause.

(a)

(1) Insert the clause at [52.222-50](/part-52/52.222-50) , Combating Trafficking in Persons, in all solicitations  and

contracts.

(2) Use the clause with its Alternate  I when the contract will be performed outside the United States

(as defined at 22.1702 ) and the contracting officer  has been notified of specific U.S. directives or

notices regarding combating trafficking in persons (such as general orders or military listings of "off-

limits" local establishments) that apply to contractor employees  at the contract place of

performance.

(b) Insert the provision at [52.222-56](/part-52/52.222-56) , Certification Regarding Trafficking in Persons Compliance

Plan, in solicitations  if

(1) It is possible that at least $700,000  of the value of the contract may be performed outside the

United States ; and

(2) The acquisition  is not entirely for commercially available off-the-shelf items.

Subpart [22.18](/part-22/22.18)  - Employment Eligibility Verification

22.1800  Scope.

This subpart prescribes policies and procedures requiring contractors to utilize the Department of

Homeland Security (DHS), United States  Citizenship and Immigration Service’s employment

eligibility verification program (E-Verify) as the means for verifying employment eligibility of certain

employees.

22.1801  Definitions.

As used in this subpart-

Commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) item -

(1) Means any item of supply that is-

(i) A commercial product  (as defined in paragraph (1) of the definition of “ commercial product ” at

[2.101](/part-2/2.101) );

(ii) Sold in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace; and

(iii) Offered to the Government, without modification, in the same form in which it is sold in the

commercial marketplace; and

(2) Does not include bulk cargo, as defined in 46 U.S.C. 40102(4) , such as agricultural products  and

petroleum products . Per 46 CFR 525.1  (c)(2), "bulk cargo" means cargo that is loaded and carried in

bulk onboard ship without mark or count, in a loose unpackaged form, having homogenous

characteristics. Bulk cargo loaded into intermodal equipment, except LASH or Seabee barges, is

subject to mark and count and, therefore, ceases to be bulk cargo.

Employee assigned to the contract  means an employee who was hired after November 6, 1986 (after

November 27, 2009, in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands), who is directly

performing work, in the United States , under a contract that is required to include the clause

prescribed at 22.1803 . An employee is not considered to be directly performing work under a

contract if the employee-

(1) Normally performs support work, such as indirect or overhead functions; and

(2) Does not perform any substantial duties applicable to the contract.

Subcontract  means any contract, as defined in [2.101](/part-2/2.101) , entered into by a subcontractor  to furnish

supplies  or services for performance of a prime contract or a subcontract . It includes but is not

limited to purchase orders , and changes and modifications to purchase orders .

Subcontractor  means any supplier, distributor, vendor, or firm that furnishes supplies  or services to

or for a prime contractor or another subcontractor .

United States , as defined in 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(38) , means the 50 States, the District of Columbia,

Puerto Rico, Guam, the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

22.1802  Policy.

(a) Statutes and Executive orders require employers to abide by the immigration laws of the United

States  and to employ in the United States  only individuals who are eligible to work in the United

States . The E-Verify program provides an Internet-based means of verifying employment eligibility of

workers employed in the United States , but is not a substitute for any other employment eligibility

verification requirements.

(b) Contracting officers  shall  include in solicitations  and contracts, as prescribed at 22.1803 ,

requirements that Federal contractors must -

(1) Enroll as Federal contractors in E-Verify;

(2) Use E-Verify to verify employment eligibility of all new hires working in the United States , except

that the contractor may choose to verify only new hires assigned to the contract if the contractor is-

(i) An institution of higher education (as defined at 20 U.S.C. 1001(a) );

(ii) A State or local government or the government of a Federally recognized Indian tribe; or

(iii) A surety  performing under a takeover agreement entered into with a Federal agency  pursuant to

a performance bond;

(3) Use E-Verify to verify employment eligibility of all employees assigned to the contract; and

(4) Include these requirements, as required by the clause at [52.222-54](/part-52/52.222-54) , in subcontracts  for-

(i) Services, except for commercial services  that are part of the purchase of a COTS item (or an item

that would be a COTS item, but for minor modifications), performed by the COTS provider, and are

normally provided for that COTS item; and

(ii) Construction .

(c) Contractors may elect to verify employment eligibility of all existing employees working in the

United States  who were hired after November 6, 1986 (after November 27, 2009, in the

Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands) instead of just those employees assigned to the

contract. The contractor is not required to verify employment eligibility of-

(1) Employees who hold an active security clearance of confidential, secret, or top secret; or

(2) Employees for whom background investigations have been completed and credentials issued

pursuant to Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12.

(d) In exceptional cases, the head of the contracting activity  may waive the E-Verify requirement for

a contract or subcontract  or a class of contracts or subcontracts , either temporarily or for the period

of performance. This waiver authority may not be delegated.

(e) DHS and the Social Security Administration (SSA) may terminate a contractor's memorandum of

understanding (MOU) and deny access to the E-Verify system in accordance with the terms of the

MOU. If DHS or SSA terminates a contractor's MOU, the terminating agency must  refer the

contractor to a suspending and debarring official  for possible suspension  or debarment  action.

During the period between termination of the MOU and a decision by the suspending and debarring

official  whether to suspend or debar, the contractor is excused from its obligations under paragraph

(b) of the clause at [52.222-54](/part-52/52.222-54) . If the contractor is suspended, debarred, or subject to a voluntary

exclusion as a result of the MOU termination, the contractor is not eligible to participate in E-Verify

during the period of its suspension , debarment , or voluntary exclusion. If the contractor is not

suspended, debarred, or subject to a voluntary exclusion, then the contractor must  re-enroll in E-

Verify.

22.1803  Contract clause.

Insert the clause at [52.222-54](/part-52/52.222-54) , Employment Eligibility Verification, in all solicitations  and contracts

that exceed $150,000, except those that—

(a) Are only for work that will be performed outside the United States ;

(b) Are for a period of performance of less than 120 days; or

(c) Are only for-

(1) Commercially available off-the-shelf items;

(2) Items that would be COTS items, but for minor modifications (as defined at paragraph (3)(ii) of

the definition of " commercial products " at [2.101](/part-2/2.101) );

(3) Items that would be COTS items if they were not bulk cargo; or

(4) Commercial services  that are-

(i) Part of the purchase of a COTS item (or an item that would be a COTS item, but for minor

modifications);

(ii) Performed by the COTS provider; and

(iii) Are normally provided for that COTS item.

22.1901  Definitions.

As used in this subpart—

United States  means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana

Islands, American Samoa, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Johnston Island, Wake Island, and the outer

Worker , (in accordance with 29 CFR [23.20](/part-23/23.20))–

(1)

(i)Means any person engaged in performing work on, or in connection with, a contract covered by

Executive Order 14026, and

(A)Whose wages under such contract are governed by the Fair Labor Standards Act ( 29 U.S.C.

chapter 8 ), the Service Contract  Labor Standards statute ( 41 U.S.C. chapter 67 ), or the Wage Rate

Requirements ( Construction ) statute ( 40 U.S.C. chapter 31 , subchapter IV),

(B)Other than individuals employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional

capacity, as those terms are defined in 29 CFR part 541,

(C)Regardless of the contractual relationship alleged to exist between the individual and the

employer.

(ii)Includes workers  performing on, or in connection with, the contract whose wages are calculated

pursuant to special certificates issued under 29 U.S.C. 214(c) .

(iii)Also includes any person working on, or in connection with, the contract and individually

registered in a bona fide apprenticeship or training program registered with the Department of

Labor's Employment and Training Administration, Office of Apprenticeship, or with a State

(2)

(i)A worker  performs on a contract if the worker  directly performs the specific services called for by

the contract; and

(ii)A worker  performs in connection with  a contract if the worker 's work activities are necessary to

22.1902  Policy.

(a) Pursuant to Executive Order 14026, the minimum hourly wage rate required to be paid to

workers  performing on, or in connection with, contracts and subcontracts subject to this subpart is—

(b) Relationship with other wage rates.

(1) Nothing in this subpart shall  excuse noncompliance with any applicable Federal or State

prevailing wage law or any applicable law or municipal ordinance or any applicable contract

establishing a minimum wage higher than the E.O. minimum wage. However, wage increases under

such other laws or municipal ordinances are not subject to price adjustment under this subpart.

(2) The E.O. minimum wage rate applies whenever it is higher than any applicable collective

bargaining agreement(s) wage rate.

(c) Application to tipped workers . Policies and procedures in DOL regulations at 29 CFR [23.240](/part-23/23.240)(b)

and [23.280](/part-23/23.280) address the relationship between the E.O. minimum wage and wages of workers

22.1903  Applicability.

(a) This subpart applies to contracts covered by the Service Contract  Labor Standards statute

(41 U.S.C. chapter 67 , formerly known as the Service Contract  Act, subpart  [22.10](/part-22/22.10) ), or the Wage

Rate Requirements ( Construction ) statute ( 40 U.S.C. chapter 31, Subchapter IV , formerly known as

Samoa, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Johnston Island, Wake Island, and the outer Continental Shelf

as defined in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act ( 43 U.S.C. 1331, et seq. )). When performance is

in part within and in part outside the United States , this subpart applies to the part of the contract

that is performed within the United States .

(b)

(1) This subpart applies to workers  as defined at 22.1901 . As provided in that definition-

(i) Workers  are covered regardless of the contractual relationship alleged to exist between the

contractor or subcontractor and the worker ;

(ii) Workers  with disabilities whose wages are calculated pursuant to special certificates issued

under 29 U.S.C. 214(c)  are covered; and

(iii) Workers  who are registered in a bona fide apprenticeship program or training program

registered with the Department of Labor’s Employment and Training Administration, Office of

Apprenticeship, or with a State Apprenticeship Agency recognized by the Office of Apprenticeship,

are covered.

(2) This subpart does not apply to-

(i) Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)-covered individuals performing in connection with contracts

covered by the E.O., i.e., those individuals who perform duties necessary to the performance of the

(c) Agency Labor Advisors , as defined at [22.001](/part-22/22.001) , are listed at https://www.sam.gov , and are available

to provide guidance and assistance with the application of this subpart.

22.1904  Annual Executive Order Minimum Wage Rate.

(a) For the E.O. minimum wage rate that becomes effective on January 30, 2022, and annually

thereafter, the Administrator  will-

(1) Notify the public of the new E.O. minimum wage rate at least 90 days before it becomes effective

by publishing a notice in the Federal Register;

(2) Publish and maintain on Wage Determinations at SAM.gov , https://www.sam.gov , or any

successor site, the E.O. minimum wage rate; and

(3) Include a general notice on wage determinations which are issued under the Service Contract

Labor Standards statute or the Wage Rate Requirements ( Construction ) statute. The notice will

provide information on the E.O. minimum wage and how to obtain annual updates.

(b)

(1) The contractor may request a price adjustment only after the effective date of a new annual E.O.

minimum wage determination published pursuant to paragraph (a). Prices will be adjusted only for

increased labor costs (including subcontractor labor costs) as a result of the annual E.O. minimum

wage, and for associated labor costs (including those for subcontractors). Associated labor costs

shall  include increases or decreases that result from changes in social security and unemployment

taxes and workers ’ compensation insurance , but will not otherwise include any amount for general

and administrative costs, overhead, or profit.

(2) The wage rate price adjustment under this clause is the lowest amount calculated by subtracting

from the new E.O. wage rate the following: the current E.O. minimum wage rate; the current service

or construction  wage determination rate under the contract (if the wage rate is applicable to that

worker ); or the actual wage currently paid the worker . If the amount is zero or below, there will be

no increase paid for this worker .

(i) Example 1 - New E.O. wage rate is $[16.10](/part-16/16.10).

Previous E.O. wage rate is $[15.70](/part-15/15.70).

The current service or construction  wage determination rate

applicable to this worker  under the contract is $[15.75](/part-15/15.75).Analysis: The calculation is

$[16.10](/part-16/16.10) - $[15.80](/part-15/15.80) = $.30.

The price adjustment for this

worker  is $.30.

The actual wage currently paid to the worker  is $[15.80](/part-15/15.80).

(ii) Example 2 - New E.O. wage rate is $[15.50](/part-15/15.50).

Previous E.O. wage rate is $[15.10](/part-15/15.10).

The current service or construction  wage determination rate

applicable to this worker  under the contract is $[15.75](/part-15/15.75).Analysis: The calculation is

$[15.50](/part-15/15.50) - $[15.80](/part-15/15.80) = -$.30.

There is no price adjustment

for this worker .

The actual wage currently paid to the worker  is $[15.80](/part-15/15.80).

(3) The contracting officer  shall  not adjust the contract price for any costs other than those

identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and shall  not provide duplicate price adjustments with

any price adjustment under clauses implementing the Service Contract  Labor Standards statute or

the Wage Rate Requirements ( Construction ) statute.

22.1905  Enforcement of Executive Order Minimum Wage Requirements.

(a) Authority.

(1) Section 5 of the E.O. grants the authority for investigating potential violations of, and obtaining

compliance with, the E.O. to the Secretary of Labor. The Secretary of Labor, in promulgating the

implementing regulations required by Section 4 of the E.O., has assigned this authority to the

Administrator . Contracting  agencies do not have authority to conduct compliance investigations

under 29 CFR part 10 or part 23 as implemented in this subpart. This does not limit the contracting

officer ’s authority to otherwise enforce the terms and conditions of the contract.

(2) Contracting officers  shall  withhold payment at the direction of the Administrator .

(3) The contracting officer  shall  withhold payment, without a request from the Administrator , if the

contractor fails to comply with the requirements in paragraph (e)(2) of [52.222-55](/part-52/52.222-55) , Minimum Wages

for Contractor Workers  Under Executive Order 14026 to furnish payroll records, until such time as

the noncompliance is corrected.

(b) Complaints.

(1) Complaints may be filed with the contracting officer  or the Administrator  by any person, entity,

or organization that believes a violation of this subpart has occurred.

(2) The identity of any individual who makes a written or oral statement as a complaint or in the

course of an investigation, as well as portions of the statement which would reveal the individual’s

identity, shall  not be disclosed in any manner to anyone other than Federal officials without the prior

consent of the individual, unless otherwise authorized by law.

(3) Upon receipt of a complaint, or if notified that the Administrator  has received a complaint, the

contracting officer  shall  report the following information, within 14 days, if available without

conducting an investigation, to the Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, Office of

Government Contracts, 200 Constitution Avenue N.W., Room S3006, Washington, D.C. 20210.

(i) The complaint or description of the alleged violation;

(ii) Available statements by the worker , contractor, or any other person regarding the alleged

violation;

(iii) Evidence that clause [52.222-55](/part-52/52.222-55) , Minimum Wages for Contractor Workers  Under Executive Order

14026, (or its predecessor for complaints under 29 CFR part 10) was included in the contract;

(iv) Information concerning known settlement negotiations between the parties, if applicable; and

(v) Any other relevant facts known to the contracting officer  or other information requested by the

Wage and Hour Division.

(c) Investigations. Complaints will be investigated by the Administrator , if warranted, in accordance

with the procedures in 29 CFR part [23.430](/part-23/23.430).

(d) Remedies and sanctions–

(1) Unpaid wages. When the Administrator ’s investigation reveals that a contractor has failed to pay

the applicable E.O. minimum wage, the Administrator  will notify the contractor and the contracting

agency of the unpaid wage violation, and request that the contractor remedy the violation. If the

contractor does not remedy the violation, the Administrator  may direct withholding of payments due

on the contract or any other contract between the contractor and the Federal Government. Upon

final decision and direction of the Administrator , the contracting  agency shall  transfer the withheld

funds to the Department of Labor for disbursement in accordance with the procedures at
