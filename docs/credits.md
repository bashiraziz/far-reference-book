# Credits & Acknowledgments

## Project Development

This FAR Reference Book was built entirely through AI-assisted development using **[Claude](https://claude.ai/)** by Anthropic. All coding, implementation, and technical architecture were developed by Claude AI working collaboratively with the project creator.

This is an open-source project. Visit our **[GitHub repository](https://github.com/bashiraziz/far-reference-book)** to explore the code and learn more.

### Development Framework

The project leverages **[SpecKit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit)**, a specification-driven development framework that enables structured collaboration between humans and AI agents. SpecKit's systematic approach to software development was instrumental in creating this comprehensive reference tool.
