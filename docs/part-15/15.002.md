# 15.002 Types of negotiated acquisition

(a) Sole source acquisitions . When contracting  in a sole source environment, the request for

proposals (RFP) should  be tailored to remove unnecessary information and requirements; e.g.,

evaluation criteria and voluminous proposal preparation instructions.

(b) Competitive acquisitions . When contracting  in a competitive environment, the procedures of this

part are intended to minimize the complexity of the solicitation , the evaluation, and the source

selection decision, while maintaining a process designed to foster an impartial and comprehensive

evaluation of offerors ’ proposals, leading to selection of the proposal representing the best value  to

the Government (see [2.101](/part-2/2.101) ).
