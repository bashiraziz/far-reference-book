(b) Contracting officers  will use FPRA rates as bases for pricing  all contracts, modifications, and

other contractual actions to be performed during the period covered by the agreement. Conditions

that may affect the agreement’s validity shall  be reported promptly to the ACO. If the ACO

determines that a changed condition invalidates the agreement, the ACO shall  notify all interested

parties of the extent of its effect and status of efforts to establish a revised FPRA.

(c) Contracting officers  shall  not require certification at the time of agreement for data supplied in

support of FPRA’s or other advance agreements. When a forward pricing rate agreement  or other

advance agreement is used to price  a contract action that requires a certificate, the certificate

supporting that contract action shall  cover the data supplied to support the FPRA or other advance

agreement, and all other data supporting the action.
