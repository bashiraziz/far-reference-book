# 3.501-2 General

(a) Buying-in  may decrease competition or result in poor contract performance. The contracting

officer  must  take appropriate action to ensure buying-in  losses are not recovered by the contractor

through the pricing  of-

(1) Change orders; or

(2) Follow-on contracts subject to cost analysis.

(b) The Government should  minimize the opportunity for buying-in  by seeking a price commitment

covering as much of the entire program concerned as is practical by using-

(1) Multiyear contracting , with a requirement in the solicitation  that a price be submitted only for

the total multi-year quantity; or

(2) Priced options  for additional quantities that, together with the firm contract quantity, equal the

program requirements (see subpart  17.2 ).

(c) Other safeguards are available to the contracting officer  to preclude recovery of buying-in  losses

(e.g., amortization of nonrecurring costs (see 15.408 , Table  15-1 , paragraph A, column (2) under

"Formats for Submission of Line Item  Summaries") and treatment of unreasonable price quotations

(see 15.405 ).
