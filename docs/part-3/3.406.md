# 3.406 Records.

For enforcement purposes, agencies shall preserve any specific evidence of one or more of the violations in [3.405](./3.405.md)(a), together with all other pertinent data, including a record of actions taken. Contracting offices shall not retire or destroy these records until it is certain that they are no longer needed for enforcement purposes. If the original record is maintained in a central file, a copy must be retained in the contract file.
