# 1.102-4 Acquisition Team

The purpose of defining the Federal Acquisition  Team (Team) in the Guiding Principles is to ensure

that participants in the System are identified beginning with the customer and ending with the

contractor of the product or service. By identifying the team members in this manner, teamwork,

unity of purpose, and open communication among the members of the Team in sharing the vision

and achieving the goal of the System are encouraged. Individual team members will participate in

the acquisition  process at the appropriate time.
