# 29.101 Resolving tax problems

(a) Contract tax problems are essentially legal in nature and vary widely. Specific tax questions must

be resolved by reference to the applicable contract terms and to the pertinent tax laws and

regulations. Therefore, when tax questions arise, contracting officers  should  request assistance from

the agency-designated legal counsel.

(b) To keep treatment within an agency consistent, contracting officers  or other authorized

personnel shall  consult the agency-designated counsel before negotiating with any taxing authority

for the purpose of-

(1) Determining whether or not a tax is valid or applicable; or

(2) Obtaining exemption from, or refund of, a tax.

(c) When the constitutional immunity of the Government from State or local taxation may reasonably

be at issue, contractors should  be discouraged from negotiating independently with taxing

authorities if the contract involved is either-

(1) A cost-reimbursement contract; or

(2) A fixed-price contract containing a tax escalation clause.

(d) Before purchasing goods or services from a foreign source, the contracting officer  should  consult

the agency-designated counsel-

(1) For information on foreign tax treaties and agreements in force and on the implementation of any

foreign-tax-relief programs; and

(2) To resolve any other tax questions affecting the prospective contract.
