# 31.205-14 Entertainment costs

Costs  of amusement, diversions, social activities, and any directly associated costs  such as tickets to

shows or sports events, meals, lodging, rentals, transportation, and gratuities are unallowable. Costs

made specifically unallowable under this cost principle are not allowable under any other cost

principle. Costs  of membership in social, dining, or country clubs or other organizations having the

same purposes are also unallowable, regardless of whether the cost is reported as taxable income to

the employees.
