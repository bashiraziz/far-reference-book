(a) This subsection is applicable to the cost of renting or leasing real or personal property  acquired

under "operating leases" as defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting

Standards Codification (FASB ASC) 840, Leases. (See [31.205-11](/part-31/31.205-11)  for Capital Leases.)

(b) The following costs  are allowable:

(1) Rental costs  under operating leases, to the extent that the rates are reasonable at the time of the

lease decision, after consideration of-

(i) Rental costs  of comparable property, if any;

(ii) Market conditions in the area;

(iii) The type, life expectancy, condition, and value of the property leased;

(iv) Alternatives available; and

(v) Other provisions of the agreement.

(2) Rental costs  under a sale and leaseback arrangement only up to the amount the contractor would

be allowed if the contractor retained title, computed based on the net book value of the asset on the

date the contractor becomes a lessee of the property adjusted for any gain or loss recognized in

accordance with [31.205-16](/part-31/31.205-16) (b).

(3) Charges in the nature of rent for property between any divisions, subsidiaries, or organizations

under common control, to the extent that they do not exceed the normal costs  of ownership, such as

depreciation , taxes, insurance , facilities capital cost of money , and maintenance (excluding interest

or other unallowable costs  pursuant to part  31 ), provided that no part of such costs  shall  duplicate

any other allowed cost. Rental cost of personal property  leased from any division, subsidiary, or

affiliate of the contractor under common control, that has an established practice of leasing the

same or similar property to unaffiliated lessees shall  be allowed in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)

of this subsection.
