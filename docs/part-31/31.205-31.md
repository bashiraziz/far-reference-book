# 31.205-31 Plant reconversion costs

Plant reconversion costs  are those incurred in restoring or rehabilitating the contractor’s facilities  to

approximately the same condition existing immediately before the start of the Government contract,

fair wear and tear excepted. Reconversion costs  are unallowable except for the cost of removing

Government property and the restoration or rehabilitation costs  caused by such removal. However,

in special circumstances where equity so dictates, additional costs  may be allowed to the extent

agreed upon before costs  are incurred. Care should  be exercised to avoid duplication through

allowance as contingencies, additional profit or fee, or in other contracts.
