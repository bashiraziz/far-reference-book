# 31.101 Objectives

In recognition of differing organizational characteristics, the cost principles and procedures in the

succeeding subparts are grouped basically by organizational type; e.g., commercial concerns and

educational institutions. The overall objective is to provide that, to the extent practicable, all

organizations of similar types doing similar work will follow the same cost principles and

procedures. To achieve this uniformity, individual deviations concerning cost principles require

advance approval of the agency head  or designee. Class deviations for the civilian agencies require

advance approval of the Civilian Agency Acquisition  Council. Class deviations for the National

Aeronautics and Space Administration require advance approval of the Deputy Chief Acquisition

Officer . Class deviations for the Department of Defense require advance approval of the Principal

Director, Defense Pricing  and Contracting , Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition

and Sustainment.
