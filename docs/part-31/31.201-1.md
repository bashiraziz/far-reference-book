# 31.201-1 Composition of total cost

(a) The total cost, including standard costs  properly adjusted for applicable variances , of a contract

is the sum of the direct and indirect costs  allocable to the contract, incurred or to be incurred, plus

any allocable cost of money pursuant to 31.205-10 , less any allocable credits. In ascertaining what

constitutes a cost, any generally accepted method of determining or estimating costs  that is

equitable and is consistently applied may be used.

(b) While the total cost of a contract includes all costs properly allocable to the contract, the

allowable costs to the Government are limited to those allocable costs which are allowable pursuant

to part  31  and applicable agency supplements.
