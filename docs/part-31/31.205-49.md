# 31.205-49 Goodwill

Goodwill, an unidentifiable intangible asset, originates under the purchase method of accounting for

a business combination when the price paid by the acquiring company  exceeds the sum of the

identifiable individual assets acquired less liabilities assumed, based upon their fair values. The

excess is commonly referred to as goodwill. Goodwill may arise from the acquisition  of a company  as

a whole or a portion thereof. Any costs  for amortization, expensing, write-off, or write-down of

goodwill (however represented) are unallowable.
