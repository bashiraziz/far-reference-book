# 31.205-39 Service and warranty costs

Service and warranty  costs  include those arising from fulfillment of any contractual obligation of a

contractor to provide services such as installation, training, correcting defects in the products ,

replacing defective parts, and making refunds in the case of inadequate performance. When not

inconsistent with the terms of the contract, service and warranty  costs  are allowable. However, care

should  be exercised to avoid duplication of the allowance as an element of both estimated product

cost and risk.
