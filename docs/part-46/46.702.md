(a) The principal purposes of a warranty  in a Government contract are-

(1) To delineate the rights and obligations of the contractor and the Government for defective items

and services; and

(2) To foster quality performance.

(b) Generally, a warranty  should  provide-

(1) A contractual right for the correction of defects notwithstanding any other requirement of the

contract pertaining to acceptance of the supplies  or services by the Government; and

(2) A stated period of time or use, or the occurrence of a specified event, after acceptance by the

Government to assert a contractual right for the correction of defects.

(c) The benefits to be derived from a warranty  must  be commensurate with the cost of the warranty

to the Government.
