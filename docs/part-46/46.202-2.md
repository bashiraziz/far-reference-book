# 46.202-2 Government reliance on inspection by contractor

(a) Except as specified in (b) of this section, the Government shall  rely on the contractor to

accomplish all inspection  and testing needed to ensure that supplies  or services acquired at or below

the simplified acquisition threshold  conform to contract quality requirements before they are

tendered to the Government (see 46.301 ).

(b) The Government shall  not rely on inspection  by the contractor if the contracting officer

determines that the Government has a need to test the supplies  or services in advance of their

tender for acceptance, or to pass judgment upon the adequacy of the contractor’s internal work

processes. In making the determination, the contracting officer  shall  consider-

(1) The nature of the supplies  and services being purchased and their intended use;

(2) The potential losses in the event of defects;

(3) The likelihood of uncontested replacement or correction of defective work; and

(4) The cost of detailed Government inspection .
