# 46.302 Fixed-price supply contracts.

The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.246-2, Inspection of Supplies-Fixed-Price, in solicitations and contracts for supplies, or services that involve the furnishing of supplies, when a fixed-price contract is contemplated and the contract amount is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The contracting officer may insert the clause in such solicitations and contracts when the contract amount is expected to be at or below the simplified acquisition threshold and inclusion of the clause is in the Government’s interest. If a fixed-price incentive contract is contemplated, the contracting officer shall use the clause with its AlternateI. If a fixed-ceiling-price contract with retroactive price redetermination is contemplated, the contracting officer shall use the clause with its AlternateII.
