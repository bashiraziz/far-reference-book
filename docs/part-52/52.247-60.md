As prescribed in [47.305-16](/part-47/47.305-16) (b)(1) , insert the following clause:

Guaranteed Shipping Characteristics (Jan 2017)

paragraph (a)(1) of this clause, to permit determination by the Government of the item shipping

costs, evaluation will be based on the shipping characteristics submitted by the offeror whose offer

produces the highest transportation costs or in the absence thereof, by the Contracting Officer’s

best estimate of the actual transportation costs. If the item shipping costs, based on the actual

shipping characteristics, exceed the item shipping costs used for evaluation purposes, the

Contractor agrees that the contract price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the difference

between the transportation costs actually incurred, and the costs which would have been incurred if

the evaluated shipping characteristics had been accurate.

establishing any liability of the successful offeror for increased transportation costs resulting from

actual shipping characteristics which differ from those used for evaluation in accordance with

paragraph (a) of this clause.
