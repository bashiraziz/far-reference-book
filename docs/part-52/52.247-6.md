# 52.247-6 Financial Statement

As prescribed in 47.207-1 (e), insert the following provision in solicitations  for transportation or for

transportation-related services to ensure that offerors  are prepared to furnish financial statements:

Financial Statement (Apr 1984)

The offeror shall, upon request, promptly furnish the Government with a current certified statement

of the offeror’s financial condition and such data as the Government may request with respect to the

offeror’s operations. The Government will use this information to determine the offeror’s financial

responsibility and ability to perform under the contract. Failure of an offeror to comply with a

request for information will subject the offer to possible rejection on responsibility grounds.

(End of clause)
