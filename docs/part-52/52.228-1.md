As prescribed in 28.101-2  , insert a provision or clause substantially as follows:

Bid Guarantee (Sept 1996)

(a) Failure to furnish a bid guarantee in the proper form and amount, by the time set for opening

of bids, may be cause for rejection of the bid.

(b) The bidder shall furnish a bid guarantee in the form of a firm commitment, e.g., bid bond

supported by good and sufficient surety or sureties  acceptable to the Government, postal money

order, certified check, cashier’s check, irrevocable letter of credit, or, under Treasury Department

regulations, certain bonds or notes of the United States. The Contracting Officer will return bid

guarantees, other than bid bonds-

(1) To unsuccessful bidders as soon as practicable after the opening of bids; and

(2) To the successful bidder upon execution of contractual documents and bonds (including

any necessary coinsurance or reinsurance agreements), as required by the bid as accepted.

(c) The amount of the bid guarantee shall be ______  percent of the bid price or $ ________ ,

whichever is less.

(d) If the successful bidder, upon acceptance of its bid by the Government within the period

specified for acceptance, fails to execute all contractual documents or furnish executed bond(s)

within 10 days after receipt of the forms by the bidder, the Contracting Officer may terminate the

contract for default.

(e) In the event the contract is terminated for default, the bidder is liable for any cost of

acquiring the work that exceeds the amount of its bid, and the bid guarantee is available to offset

the difference.
