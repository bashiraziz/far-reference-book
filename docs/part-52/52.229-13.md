# 52.229-13 Taxes—Foreign Contracts in Afghanistan

As prescribed in 29.402-4 (a), use the following clause:

Taxes—Foreign Contracts in Afghanistan (Nov 2021)

(a) Definition. U.S. Forces , as used in this clause, means the entity comprising the members of

the force and of the civilian component, and all property, equipment, and materiel of the United

States Armed Forces present in the territory of Afghanistan.

(b) Tax exemption.  This acquisition is covered by the Security and Defense Cooperation

Agreement (the Agreement) between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (Afghanistan) and the

United States of America signed on September 30, 2014, and entered into force on January 1, 2015.

(1) The Agreement exempts the United States Government, and its contractors and

subcontractors (other than those that are Afghan legal entities or residents), from paying any tax or

similar charge assessed by the Government of Afghanistan on activities associated with this contract

within Afghanistan if the activities are on behalf of or in support of U.S. Forces. The Agreement also

exempts the acquisition, importation, exportation, reexportation, transportation, and use of supplies

and services in Afghanistan, on behalf of or in support of U.S. Forces, from any taxes, customs,

duties, fees, or similar charges imposed by the Government of Afghanistan.

(2) The Contractor shall exclude any Afghan taxes, customs, duties, fees, or similar charges

from the contract price, other than those charged to Afghan legal entities or residents.

(3) The Agreement does not exempt Afghan employees of Government contractors and

subcontractors from Afghan tax laws. To the extent required by Afghan law, the Contractor shall

withhold tax from the wages of these employees and remit those payments to the appropriate

Afghan taxing authority. These withholdings are an individual's liability, not a tax against the

Contractor.

(c) Subcontracts. The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this

paragraph (c), in all subcontracts including subcontracts for commercial products  or commercial

services .

(End of clause)
