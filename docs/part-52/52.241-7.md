# 52.241-7 Change in Rates or Terms and Conditions of Service for Regulated Services

As prescribed in 41.501 (d)(1) , insert a clause substantially the same as the following:

Change in Rates or Terms and Conditions of Service for Regulated Services (Feb 1995)

(a) This clause applies to the extent services furnished under this contract are subject to

regulation by a regulatory body. The Contractor agrees to give * ________________  written notice of (1)

the filing of an application for change in rates or terms and conditions of service concurrently with

the filing of the application and (2) any changes pending with the regulatory body as of the date of

contract award. Such notice shall fully describe the proposed change. If, during the term of this

contract, the regulatory body having jurisdiction approves any changes, the Contractor shall forward

to the Contracting Officer a copy of such changes within 15 days after the effective date thereof. The

Contractor agrees to continue furnishing service under this contract in accordance with the

amended tariff, and the Government agrees to pay for such service at the higher or lower rates as of

the date when such rates are made effective.

(b) The Contractor agrees that throughout the life of this contract the applicable published and

unpublished rate schedule(s) shall not be in excess of the lowest cost published and unpublished

rate schedule(s) available to any other customers of the same class under similar conditions of use

and service.

(c) In the event that the regulatory body promulgates any regulation concerning matters other

than rates which affects this contract, the Contractor shall immediately provide a copy to the

Contracting Officer. The Government shall not be bound to accept any new regulation inconsistent

with Federal laws or regulations.

(d) Any changes to rates or terms and conditions of service shall be made a part of this contract

by the issuance of a contract modification unless otherwise specified in the contract. The effective

date of the change shall be the effective date by the regulatory body. Any factors not governed by

the regulatory body will have an effective date as agreed to by the parties.

* Note: Insert language prescribed in 41.501 (d)(1).

(End of clause)
