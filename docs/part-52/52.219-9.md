socioeconomic status as a small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small

business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, or a women-owned small business if the

regarding the subcontractor's size or socioeconomic status.

(d) The Offeror’s subcontracting plan shall include the following:

(1) Separate goals, expressed in terms of total dollars subcontracted, and as a percentage of

total planned subcontracting dollars, for the use of small business, veteran-owned small business,

service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged

business, and women-owned small business concerns  as subcontractors. For individual

subcontracting plans , and if required by the Contracting Officer, goals shall also be expressed in

terms of percentage of total contract dollars, in addition to the goals expressed as a percentage of

total subcontract dollars. The Offeror shall include all subcontracts  that contribute to contract

performance, and may include a proportionate share of products and services that are normally

allocated as indirect costs . In accordance with 43 U.S.C. 1626 :

(C) The ANC or Indian tribe shall give a copy of the written designation to the

Contracting Officer, the prime Contractor, and the subcontractors in between the prime Contractor

and the ANC or Indian tribe within 30 days of the date of the subcontract award.

(D) If the Contracting Officer does not receive a copy of the ANC’s or the Indian tribe’s

written designation within 30 days of the subcontract award, the Contractor that awarded the

subcontract to the ANC or Indian tribe will be considered the designated Contractor.

(2) A statement of–

(i) Total dollars planned to be subcontracted for an individual subcontracting plan; or the

including all indirect costs  except as described in paragraph (g) of this clause, to support the sales

disadvantaged, and women-owned small business trade associations). A firm may rely on the

information contained in SAM as an accurate representation of a concern's size and ownership

characteristics for the purposes of maintaining a small, veteran-owned small, service-disabled

veteran-owned small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business

source list. Use of SAM as its source list does not relieve a firm of its responsibilities ( e.g., outreach,

assistance, counseling, or publicizing subcontracting opportunities) in this clause.

subcontracting goals, and a description of the method used to determine the proportionate share of

Small Business Concerns" in all subcontracts  that offer further subcontracting opportunities, and

that the Offeror will require all subcontractors (except small business concerns) that receive

subcontracts  in excess of the applicable threshold specified in FAR 19.702 (a) on the date of

(ii) Submit periodic reports so that the Government can determine the extent of

compliance by the Offeror with the subcontracting plan;

(iv) Submit the Individual Subcontract Report (ISR) and/or the Summary Subcontract

Report (SSR), in accordance with paragraph (l) of this clause using the Electronic Subcontracting

Reporting System (eSRS) at http://www.esrs.gov . The reports shall provide information on

ANCs and Indian tribes  that have not been certified by the Small Business Administration as small

disadvantaged businesses), women-owned small business concerns , and for NASA only, Historically

of the Offeror’s official responsible for acknowledging receipt of or rejecting the ISRs, to all first-tier

subcontractors with subcontracting plans so they can enter this information into the eSRS when

submitting their ISRs; and

(vii) Require that each subcontractor with a subcontracting plan provide the prime

contract number, its own unique entity identifier, and the e-mail address of the subcontractor’s

official responsible for acknowledging receipt of or rejecting the ISRs, to its subcontractors with

subcontracting plans.

(11) A description of the types of records that will be maintained concerning procedures that

have been adopted to comply with the requirements and goals in the plan, including establishing

source lists; and a description of the offeror’s efforts to locate small business, veteran-owned small

business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small

disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns  and award subcontracts  to

them. The records shall include at least the following (on a plant-wide or company-wide basis, unless

otherwise indicated):

(i) Source lists ( e.g., SAM), guides, and other data that identify small business, veteran-

owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business,

simplified acquisition threshold, as defined in FAR 2.101  on the date of subcontract award,

indicating-

(C) Whether service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns  were solicited

and, if not, why not;

(D) Whether HUBZone small business concerns were solicited and, if not, why not;

(12) Assurances that the Offeror will make a good faith effort to acquire articles, equipment,

supplies, services, or materials, or obtain the performance of construction work from the small

business concerns that it used in preparing the bid or proposal, in the same or greater scope,

amount, and quality used in preparing and submitting the bid or proposal. Responding to a request

for a quote does not constitute use in preparing a bid or proposal. The Offeror used a small business

concern in preparing the bid or proposal if–

(i) The Offeror identifies the small business concern as a subcontractor in the bid or

proposal or associated small business subcontracting plan, to furnish certain supplies or perform a

portion of the subcontract; or

(ii) The Offeror used the small business concern's pricing or cost information or technical

expertise in preparing the bid or proposal, where there is written evidence of an intent or

understanding that the small business concern will be awarded a subcontract for the related work if

the Offeror is awarded the contract.

(13) Assurances that the Contractor will provide the Contracting Officer with a written

explanation if the Contractor fails to acquire articles, equipment, supplies, services or materials or

obtain the performance of construction work as described in (d)(12) of this clause. This written

explanation must be submitted to the Contracting Officer within 30 days of contract completion.

(14) Assurances that the Contractor will not prohibit a subcontractor from discussing with the

Contracting Officer any material matter pertaining to payment to or utilization of a subcontractor.

(15) Assurances that the offeror will pay its small business subcontractors  on time and in

accordance with the terms and conditions of the underlying subcontract, and notify the contracting

officer when the prime contractor makes either a reduced or an untimely payment to a small

business subcontractor (see 52.242-5 ).

(e) In order to effectively implement this plan to the extent consistent with efficient contract

performance, the Contractor shall perform the following functions:

(1) Assist small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small

business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business

concerns  by arranging solicitations , time for the preparation of bids, quantities, specifications, and

delivery schedules so as to facilitate the participation by such concerns. Where the Contractor’s lists

of potential small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small

business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business

subcontractors  are excessively long, reasonable effort shall be made to give all such small business

concerns an opportunity to compete over a period of time.

(2) Provide adequate and timely consideration of the potentialities of small business, veteran-

owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business,

small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns  in all "make-or-buy"

decisions.

(3) Counsel and discuss subcontracting opportunities with representatives of small business,

veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small

business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business firms.

(4) Confirm that a subcontractor representing itself as a HUBZone small business concern is

certified by SBA as a HUBZone small business concern by accessing SAM or by accessing the

Dynamic Small Business Search (DSBS) at https://web.sba.gov/​pro-net/​search/​dsp_​dsbs.cfm .

(5) Provide notice to subcontractors concerning penalties and remedies for

misrepresentations of business status as small, veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small, small

disadvantaged, or women-owned small business for the purpose of obtaining a subcontract that is to

be included as part or all of a goal contained in the Contractor’s subcontracting plan.

(6) For all competitive subcontracts  over the simplified acquisition threshold, as defined in

FAR 2.101  on the date of subcontract award, in which a small business concern received a small

business preference, upon determination of the successful subcontract offeror, prior to award of the

subcontract the Contractor must inform each unsuccessful small business subcontract offeror in

writing of the name and location of the apparent successful offeror and if the successful subcontract

offeror is a small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small

business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, or women-owned small business

concern.

(7) Assign each subcontract the NAICS code and corresponding size standard that best

describes the principal purpose of the subcontract.

(f) A master subcontracting plan on a plant or division-wide basis that contains all the elements

required by paragraph (d) of this clause, except goals, may be incorporated by reference as a part of

the subcontracting plan required of the Offeror by this clause; provided-

(1) The master subcontracting plan has been approved;

(2) The Offeror ensures that the master subcontracting plan is updated as necessary and

provides copies of the approved master subcontracting plan, including evidence of its approval, to

the Contracting Officer; and

(3) Goals and any deviations from the master subcontracting plan deemed necessary by the

Contracting Officer to satisfy the requirements of this contract are set forth in the individual

subcontracting plan.

(g) A commercial plan is the preferred type of subcontracting plan for contractors furnishing

commercial products  and commercial services . The commercial plan shall relate to the offeror’s

planned subcontracting generally, for both commercial and Government business, rather than solely

to the Government contract. Once the Contractor’s commercial plan has been approved, the

Government will not require another subcontracting plan from the same Contractor while the plan

remains in effect, as long as the product or service being provided by the Contractor continues to

meet the definition of a commercial product or commercial service. A Contractor with a commercial

plan shall comply with the reporting requirements stated in paragraph (d)(10) of this clause by

submitting one SSR in eSRS for all contracts covered by its commercial plan. A Contractor

authorized to use a commercial subcontracting plan shall include in its subcontracting goals and in

its SSR all indirect costs , with the exception of those such as the following: Employee salaries and

benefits; payments for petty cash; depreciation; interest; income taxes; property taxes; lease

payments; bank fees; fines, claims , and dues; original equipment manufacturer relationships during

warranty periods (negotiated up front with the product); utilities and other services purchased from

a municipality or an entity solely authorized by the municipality to provide those services in a

particular geographical region; and philanthropic contributions. This report shall be acknowledged

or rejected in eSRS by the Contracting Officer who approved the plan. This report shall be submitted

within 30 days after the end of the Government’s fiscal year.

(h) Prior compliance of the offeror with other such subcontracting plans under previous

contracts will be considered by the Contracting Officer in determining the responsibility of the

offeror for award of the contract.

(i) A contract may have no more than one subcontracting plan. When a contract modification

exceeds the subcontracting plan threshold in FAR 19.702 (a), or an option is exercised, the goals of

the existing subcontracting plan shall be amended to reflect any new subcontracting opportunities.

When the goals in a subcontracting plan are amended, these goal changes do not apply retroactively.

(j) Subcontracting plans are not required from subcontractors when the prime contract contains

the clause at FAR 52.212-5 , Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or

Executive Orders- Commercial Products  and Commercial Services , or when the subcontractor

provides a commercial product or commercial service subject to the clause at FAR 52.244-6 ,

Subcontracts  for Commercial Products  and Commercial Services , under a prime contract.

(k) The failure of the Contractor or subcontractor to comply in good faith with (1) the clause of

this contract entitled "Utilization Of Small Business Concerns;" or (2) an approved plan required by

this clause, shall be a material breach of the contract and may be considered in any past

performance evaluation of the Contractor.

(l) The Contractor shall submit ISRs and SSRs using the web-based eSRS at http://www.esrs.gov .

Purchases from a corporation, company, or subdivision that is an affiliate of the Contractor or

subcontractor are not included in these reports. Subcontract awards by affiliates shall be treated as

subcontract awards by the Contractor. Subcontract award data reported by the Contractor and

subcontractors shall be limited to awards made to their immediate next-tier subcontractors. Credit

cannot be taken for awards made to lower tier subcontractors, unless the Contractor or

subcontractor has been designated to receive a small business or small disadvantaged business

credit from an ANC or Indian tribe. Only subcontracts  involving performance in the United States or

its outlying areas should be included in these reports with the exception of subcontracts  under a

contract awarded by the State Department or any other agency that has statutory or regulatory

authority to require subcontracting plans for subcontracts  performed outside the United States and

otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer. Reports are required when due, regardless of

whether there has been any subcontracting activity since the inception of the contract or the

previous reporting period. When the Contracting Officer rejects an ISR, the Contractor shall submit

a corrected report within 30 days of receiving the notice of ISR rejection.

(ii)

(A) When a subcontracting plan contains separate goals for the basic contract and each option, as

prescribed by FAR 19.704 (c), the dollar goal inserted on this report shall be the sum of the base

period through the current option; for example, for a report submitted after the second option is

exercised, the dollar goal would be the sum of the goals for the basic contract, the first option, and

the second option.

(B) If a subcontracting plan has been added to the contract pursuant to 19.702  a)(1)(iii)

or 19.301-2 (e), the Contractor's achievements must be reported in the ISR on a cumulative basis

from the date of incorporation of the subcontracting plan into the contract.

(iii) When a subcontracting plan includes indirect costs  in the goals, these costs must be

included in this report.
