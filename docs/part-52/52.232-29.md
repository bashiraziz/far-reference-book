services due under the contract will be delivered or performed in accordance with the contract; and

there has been no impairment or diminution of the Government’s security under this contract.

(b) Special terms regarding termination for cause . If this contract is terminated for cause, the

Contractor shall, on demand, repay to the Government the amount of unliquidated contract

financing payments. The Government shall be liable for no payment except as provided by the

financing. If at any time the Contracting Officer determines that the security provided by the

Contractor is insufficient, the Contractor shall promptly provide such additional security as the

Contracting Officer determines necessary. In the event the Contractor fails to provide such

additional security, the Contracting Officer may collect or liquidate such security that has been

provided and suspend further payments to the Contractor; and the Contractor shall repay to the

Government the amount of unliquidated financing payments as the Contracting Officer at his sole

discretion deems repayable.

exercise under this clause or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege of the Government.

payment shall contain the following:
