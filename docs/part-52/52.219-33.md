# 52.219-33 Nonmanufacturer Rule

As prescribed in [19.507](/part-19/19.507) (h), insert the following clause:

Nonmanufacturer Rule (Sep 2021)

(a) Definitions . As used in this clause—

Manufacturer  means the concern that transforms raw materials, miscellaneous parts, or

components  into the end item. Concerns that only minimally alter the item being procured do not

qualify as manufacturers  of the end item. Concerns that add substances, parts, or components  to an

existing end item to modify its performance will not be considered the end item manufacturer,

where those identical modifications can be performed by and are available from the manufacturer of

the existing end item.

Nonmanufacturer  means a concern, including a supplier, that provides an end item it did not

manufacture, process, or produce.

(b) Applicability.

(1) This clause does not apply to contracts awarded pursuant to the unrestricted portion of a

partial set-aside or to a contractor that is the manufacturer of the product or end item.

(2) This clause applies to—

the United States or its outlying areas; for kit assemblers who are nonmanufacturers , see paragraph

(c)(2) of this clause instead;

(ii)Be primarily engaged in the retail or wholesale trade and normally sell the type of item

being supplied; and

(iii)Take ownership or possession of the item(s) with its personnel, equipment, or facilities

in a manner consistent with industry practice; for example, providing storage, transportation, or

delivery.

(2)When the end item being acquired is a kit of supplies, at least 50 percent of the total cost
