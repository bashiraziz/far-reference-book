As prescribed in [42.709-7](/part-42/42.709-7) , use the following clause:

Penalties for Unallowable Costs  (Sep 2021)

(a) Definition.  Proposal , as used in this clause, means either—

(1) A final indirect cost rate proposal submitted by the Contractor after the expiration of its

fiscal year which-

(i) Relates to any payment made on the basis of billing rates; or

(ii) Will be used in negotiating the final contract price; or

(2) The final statement of costs incurred and estimated to be incurred under the Incentive

Price Revision clause (if applicable), which is used to establish the final contract price.

(b) Contractors which include unallowable indirect costs  in a proposal may be subject to

penalties. The penalties are prescribed in 10 U.S.C.2324  or 41 U.S.C.chapter 43 , as applicable,

which is implemented in Section [42.709](/part-42/42.709)  of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).

(c) The Contractor shall not include in any proposal any cost that is unallowable, as defined in

subpart [2.1](/part-2/2.1) of the FAR, or an executive agency supplement to the FAR.

(d) If the Contracting Officer determines that a cost submitted by the Contractor in its proposal

is expressly unallowable under a cost principle in the FAR, or an executive agency supplement to the

FAR, that defines the allowability of specific selected costs, the Contractor shall be assessed a

penalty equal to–

(1) The amount of the disallowed cost allocated to this contract; plus

(2) Simple interest, to be computed-

(i) On the amount the Contractor was paid (whether as a progress or billing payment) in

excess of the amount to which the Contractor was entitled; and

(ii) Using the applicable rate effective for each six-month interval prescribed by the

Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to Pub.L.92-41 (85 Stat.97).

(e) If the Contracting Officer determines that a cost submitted by the Contractor in its proposal

includes a cost previously determined to be unallowable for that Contractor, then the Contractor will

be assessed a penalty in an amount equal to two times the amount of the disallowed cost allocated to

this contract.

(f) Determinations under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this clause are final decisions within the

meaning of 41 U.S.C. chapter 71 , Contract Disputes.

(g) Pursuant to the criteria in FAR [42.709-6](/part-42/42.709-6) , the Contracting Officer may waive the penalties in

paragraph (d) or (e) of this clause.

(h) Payment by the Contractor of any penalty assessed under this clause does not constitute

repayment to the Government of any unallowable cost which has been paid by the Government to

the Contractor.
