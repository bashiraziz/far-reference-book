Limitation of Liability-Services (Feb 1997)

(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this clause, and except to the extent that the

Contractor is expressly responsible under this contract for deficiencies in the services required to be

performed under it (including any materials furnished in conjunction with those services), the

Contractor shall not be liable for loss of or damage to property of the Government that-

(1) Occurs after Government acceptance of services performed under this contract; and

(2) Results from any defects or deficiencies in the services performed or materials furnished.

(b) The limitation of liability under paragraph (a) of this clause shall not apply when a defect or

from willful misconduct or lack of good faith on the part of any of the Contractor’s managerial

personnel. The term "Contractor’s managerial personnel," as used in this clause, means the

Contractor’s directors, officers, and any of the Contractor’s managers, superintendents, or

equivalent representatives who have supervision or direction of-

(2) All or substantially all of the Contractor’s operations at any one plant, laboratory, or

separate location at which the contract is being performed; or

(3) A separate and complete major industrial operation connected with the performance of

this contract.

(c) If the Contractor carries insurance, or has established a reserve for self-insurance, covering

liability for loss or damage suffered by the Government through the Contractor’s performance of

services or furnishing of materials under this contract, the Contractor shall be liable to the

Government, to the extent of such insurance or reserve, for loss of or damage to property of the

Government occurring after Government acceptance of, and resulting from any defects and

deficiencies in, services performed or materials furnished under this contract.
