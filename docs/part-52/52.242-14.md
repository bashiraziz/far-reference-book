# 52.242-14 Suspension of Work

As prescribed in 42.1305 (a), insert the following clause in solicitations  and contracts when a fixed-

price construction or architect-engineer contract is contemplated:

Suspension of Work (Apr 1984)

(a) The Contracting Officer may order the Contractor, in writing, to suspend, delay, or interrupt

all or any part of the work of this contract for the period of time that the Contracting Officer

determines appropriate for the convenience of the Government.

(b) If the performance of all or any part of the work is, for an unreasonable period of time,

suspended, delayed, or interrupted (1)by an act of the Contracting Officer in the administration of

this contract, or (2)by the Contracting Officer’s failure to act within the time specified in this

contract (or within a reasonable time if not specified), an adjustment shall be made for any increase

in the cost of performance of this contract (excluding profit) necessarily caused by the unreasonable

suspension, delay, or interruption, and the contract modified in writing accordingly. However, no

adjustment shall be made under this clause for any suspension, delay, or interruption to the extent

that performance would have been so suspended, delayed, or interrupted by any other cause,

including the fault or negligence of the Contractor, or for which an equitable adjustment is provided

for or excluded under any other term or condition of this contract.

(c) A claim under this clause shall not be allowed-

(1) For any costs incurred more than 20 days before the Contractor shall have notified the

Contracting Officer in writing of the act or failure to act involved (but this requirement shall not

apply as to a claim resulting from a suspension order); and

(2) Unless the claim, in an amount stated, is asserted in writing as soon as practicable after

the termination of the suspension, delay, or interruption, but not later than the date of final payment

under the contract.
