accommodate shipment;

(3) Deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the carrier, and load, stow, trim,

the ordering agency.

(c) These Contractor responsibilities are specified for performance at the plant or plants at

which the supplies are to be finally inspected and accepted, unless the facilities for shipment by

shall be performed f.o.b. the point or points in the same or nearest city where the specified carrier’s

facilities are available; subject, however, to the following qualifications:

(1) If the Contractor’s shipping plant is located in the State of Alaska or Hawaii, the

Contractor shall deliver the supplies listed for shipment outside Alaska or Hawaii to the port of

loading in Alaska or Hawaii, respectively, as specified in the contract, at Contractor’s expense, and

to that extent the contract shall be "f.o.b. destination."

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this clause, if the Contractor’s shipping plant is

located in the State of Hawaii, and the contract requires delivery to be made by container service,

the Contractor shall deliver the supplies, at the Contractor’s expense, to the container yard in the

same or nearest city where seavan container service is available.
