Notice of Earned Value Management System-Preaward Integrated Baseline Review. (Nov 2016)

(a) The offeror shall provide documentation that the Cognizant Federal Agency has determined

that the proposed earned value management system (EVMS) complies with the EVMS guidelines in

Electronic Industries Alliance Standard 748(EIA-748) (current version at time of solicitation).

(b) If the offeror proposes to use a system that has not been determined to be in compliance with

the requirements of paragraph (a) of this provision, the offeror shall submit a comprehensive plan

for compliance with the EVMS guidelines.

(1) The plan shall-

(i) (i) Describe the EVMS the offeror intends to use in performance of the contracts;

(ii) Distinguish between the offeror’s existing management system and modifications

proposed to meet the guidelines;

(iii) (iii) Describe the management system and its application in terms of the EVMS

guidelines;

(iv) (iv) Describe the proposed procedure for administration of the guidelines, as applied to

subcontractors; and

(v) (v) Provide documentation describing the process and results of any third-party or self-

evaluation of the system’s compliance with the EVMS guidelines.

(2) The offeror shall provide information and assistance as required by the Contracting

Officer to support review of the plan.

(3) The Government will review and approve the offeror’s plan for an EVMS before contract

award.

(4) The offeror’s EVMS plan must provide milestones that indicate when the offeror

anticipates that the EVM system will be compliant with the EIA-748 guidelines.

to jointly assess technical areas, such as the Contractor’s planning, to ensure complete coverage of

the contract requirements, logical scheduling of the work activities, adequate resources,

methodologies for earned value (budgeted cost for work performed (BCWP)), and identification of

inherent risks.
