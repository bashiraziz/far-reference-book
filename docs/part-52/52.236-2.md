Differing Site Conditions (Apr 1984)

changed as a result of the conditions, an equitable adjustment shall be made under this clause and

the contract modified in writing accordingly.

(c) No request by the Contractor for an equitable adjustment to the contract under this clause

shall be allowed, unless the Contractor has given the written notice required; provided , that the time

prescribed in paragraph (a) of this clause for giving written notice may be extended by the

Contracting Officer.

(d) No request by the Contractor for an equitable adjustment to the contract for differing site

conditions shall be allowed if made after final payment under this contract.
