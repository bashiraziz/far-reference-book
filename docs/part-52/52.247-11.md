# 52.247-11 Net Weight-Household Goods or Office Furniture

As prescribed in 47.207-4 (b), insert the following clause in contracts for transportation or for

transportation-related services when movements of Government employees’ household goods or

relocations of Government offices are involved:

Net Weight-Household Goods or Office Furniture (Apr 1984)

(a) Net weight-full loads.  The net weight of the shipment shall be determined by deducting the

tare weight of the vehicle (determined by having a certified weighmaster weigh on a certified scale

the empty vehicle with all blankets, pads, chains, dollies, hand trucks, and all other necessary

equipment inside the vehicle) from the gross weight of the vehicle (determined by having a certified

weighmaster weigh on a certified scale the fully loaded vehicle before arrival at destination).

(b) Net weight-part loads.  The net weight of the first part load shall be determined in the same

manner as specified for a full load. The net weight of the second part load shall be determined by

using as the tare weight of the vehicle the gross weight of the vehicle containing the first part load

and deducting this weight from the new gross weight (determined by having the loaded vehicle

weighed again, in the same manner as specified for the full load). The same procedure shall apply

for each succeeding part load.

(c) Weight certificates.  The contractor shall attach the original copy of each weight certificate to

the invoice for services.

(End of clause)
