# 52.247-34 F.o.b. Destination

As prescribed in 47.303-6 (c), insert the following clause:

F.o.b. Destination (Nov 1991)

(a) The term "f.o.b. destination," as used in this clause, means-

(1) Free of expense to the Government, on board the carrier’s conveyance, at a specified

delivery point where the consignee’s facility (plant, warehouse, store, lot, or other location to which

shipment can be made) is located; and

(2) Supplies shall be delivered to the destination consignee’s wharf (if destination is a port

city and supplies are for export), warehouse unloading platform, or receiving dock, at the expense of

the Contractor. The Government shall not be liable for any delivery, storage, demurrage, accessorial,

or other charges involved before the actual delivery (or "constructive placement" as defined in

carrier tariffs) of the supplies to the destination, unless such charges are caused by an act or order

of the Government acting in its contractual capacity. If rail carrier is used, supplies shall be

delivered to the specified unloading platform of the consignee. If motor carrier (including

"piggyback") is used, supplies shall be delivered to truck tailgate at the unloading platform of the

consignee, except when the supplies delivered meet the requirements of Item568 of the National

Motor Freight Classification for "heavy or bulky freight." When supplies meeting the requirements of

the referenced Item568 are delivered, unloading (including movement to the tailgate) shall be

performed by the consignee, with assistance from the truck driver, if requested. If the contractor

uses rail carrier or freight forwarded for less than carload shipments , the contractor shall ensure

that the carrier will furnish tailgate delivery, when required, if transfer to truck is required to

complete delivery to consignee.

(b) The Contractor shall-

(1)

(i) Pack and mark the shipment to comply with contract specifications; or

(ii) In the absence of specifications, prepare the shipment in conformance with carrier

requirements;

(2) Prepare and distribute commercial bills of lading;

(3) Deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the

contract;

(4) Be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt of the

shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the contract;

(5) Furnish a delivery schedule and designate the mode of delivering carrier; and

(6) Pay and bear all charges to the specified point of delivery.

(End of clause)
