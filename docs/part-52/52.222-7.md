# 52.222-7 Withholding of Funds

As prescribed in 22.407 (a), insert the following clause:

Withholding of Funds (May 2014)

The Contracting Officer shall, upon his or her own action or upon written request of an authorized

representative of the Department of Labor, withhold or cause to be withheld from the Contractor

under this contract or any other Federal contract with the same Prime Contractor, or any other

federally assisted contract subject to prevailing wage requirements, which is held by the same Prime

Contractor, so much of the accrued payments or advances as may be considered necessary to pay

laborers and mechanics, including apprentices, trainees, and helpers, employed by the Contractor or

any subcontractor the full amount of wages required by the contract. In the event of failure to pay

any laborer or mechanic, including any apprentice, trainee, or helper, employed or working on the

site of the work, all or part of the wages required by the contract, the Contracting Officer may, after

written notice to the Contractor, take such action as may be necessary to cause the suspension of

any further payment, advance, or guarantee of funds until such violations have ceased.
