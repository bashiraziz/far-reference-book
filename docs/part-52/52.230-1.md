# 52.230-1 Cost Accounting Standards Notices and Certification

As prescribed in [30.201-3](/part-30/30.201-3)  (a), insert the following provision:

Cost Accounting Standards Notices and Certification (Jun 2020)

Note: This notice does not apply to small businesses or foreign governments. This notice is in three

parts, identified by Roman numerals I through III.

Offerors  shall examine each part and provide the requested information in order to determine Cost

Accounting Standards (CAS) requirements applicable to any resultant contract.

If the offeror is an educational institution, Part II does not apply unless the contemplated contract

will be subject to full or modified CAS coverage pursuant to 48 CFR 9903.201-2(c)(5) or

9903.201-2(c)(6), respectively.

I. Disclosure Statement-Cost Accounting Practices and Certification

(a) Any contract in excess of the lower CAS threshold specified in Federal Acquisition Regulation

(FAR) [30.201-4](/part-30/30.201-4)(b) resulting from this solicitation will be subject to the requirements of the Cost

Accounting Standards Board (48 CFR chapter 99), except for those contracts which are exempt as

specified in 48 CFR 9903.201-1.

(b) Any offeror submitting a proposal which, if accepted, will result in a contract subject to the

requirements of 48 CFR chapter 99 must, as a condition of contracting, submit a Disclosure

Statement as required by 48 CFR 9903.202 . When required, the Disclosure Statement must be

submitted as a part of the offeror’s proposal under this solicitation unless the offeror has already

submitted a Disclosure Statement disclosing the practices used in connection with the pricing of this

proposal. If an applicable Disclosure Statement has already been submitted, the offeror may satisfy

the requirement for submission by providing the information requested in paragraph (c) of Part I of

this provision.

Caution: In the absence of specific regulations or agreement, a practice disclosed in a Disclosure

Statement shall not, by virtue of such disclosure, be deemed to be a proper, approved, or agreed-to

practice for pricing proposals or accumulating and reporting contract performance cost data.

(c) Check the appropriate box below:

(1) □ Certificate of Concurrent Submission of Disclosure Statement . The offeror hereby

certifies that, as a part of the offer, copies of the Disclosure Statement have been submitted as

follows:

(i) Original and one copy to the cognizant Administrative Contracting Officer (ACO) or

cognizant Federal agency official authorized to act in that capacity (Federal official), as applicable;

and

(ii) One copy to the cognizant Federal auditor.

(Disclosure must be on Form No. CASB DS-1 or CASB DS-2, as applicable. Forms may be

obtained from the cognizant ACO or Federal official.)

Date of Disclosure Statement: _________________________ Name and Address of Cognizant

ACO or Federal Official Where Filed: _______________________________________

The offeror further certifies that the practices used in estimating costs in pricing this

proposal are consistent with the cost accounting practices disclosed in the Disclosure Statement.

(2) □ Certificate of Previously Submitted Disclosure Statement . The offeror hereby certifies

that the required Disclosure Statement was filed as follows:

Date of Disclosure Statement: _________________________ Name and Address of Cognizant ACO

or Federal Official Where Filed: _______________________________________

The offeror further certifies that the practices used in estimating costs in pricing this proposal

are consistent with the cost accounting practices disclosed in the applicable Disclosure Statement.

(3) □ Certificate of Monetary Exemption . The offeror hereby certifies that the offeror,

together with all divisions, subsidiaries, and affiliates under common control, did not receive net

awards of negotiated prime contracts and subcontracts subject to CAS totaling $50 million or more

in the cost accounting period immediately preceding the period in which this proposal was

submitted. The offeror further certifies that if such status changes before an award resulting from

this proposal, the offeror will advise the Contracting Officer immediately.

(4) □ Certificate of Interim Exemption . The offeror hereby certifies that (i) the offeror first

exceeded the monetary exemption for disclosure, as defined in (3) of this subsection, in the cost

accounting period immediately preceding the period in which this offer was submitted and (ii) in

accordance with 48 CFR 9903.202-1 , the offeror is not yet required to submit a Disclosure

Statement. The offeror further certifies that if an award resulting from this proposal has not been

made within 90 days after the end of that period, the offeror will immediately submit a revised

certificate to the Contracting Officer, in the form specified under paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of PartI

of this provision, as appropriate, to verify submission of a completed Disclosure Statement.

Caution: Offerors  currently required to disclose because they were awarded a CAS-covered

prime contract or subcontract of $50 million or more in the current cost accounting period may not

claim this exemption (4). Further, the exemption applies only in connection with proposals submitted

before expiration of the 90-day period following the cost accounting period in which the monetary

exemption was exceeded.

II. Cost Accounting Standards-Eligibility for Modified Contract Coverage

If the offeror is eligible to use the modified provisions of 48 CFR 9903.201-2(b)  and elects to

do so, the offeror shall indicate by checking the box below. Checking the box below shall mean that

the resultant contract is subject to the Disclosure and Consistency of Cost Accounting Practices

clause in lieu of the Cost Accounting Standards clause.

□ The offeror hereby claims  an exemption from the Cost Accounting Standards clause under

the provisions of 48 CFR 9903.201-2(b)  and certifies that the offeror is eligible for use of the

Disclosure and Consistency of Cost Accounting Practices clause because during the cost accounting

period immediately preceding the period in which this proposal was submitted, the offeror received

less than $50 million in awards of CAS-covered prime contracts and subcontracts. The offeror

further certifies that if such status changes before an award resulting from this proposal, the offeror

will advise the Contracting Officer immediately.

Caution: An offeror may not claim the above eligibility for modified contract coverage if this

proposal is expected to result in the award of a CAS-covered contract of $50 million or more or if,

during its current cost accounting period, the offeror has been awarded a single CAS-covered prime

contract or subcontract of $50 million or more.

III. Additional Cost Accounting Standards Applicable to Existing Contracts

The offeror shall indicate below whether award of the contemplated contract would, in

accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of the Cost Accounting Standards clause, require a change in

established cost accounting practices affecting existing contracts and subcontracts.

□ Yes □ No
