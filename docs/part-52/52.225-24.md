regarding the inapplicability of section 1605 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of

2009 (Pub. L. 111-5) (Recovery Act) or the Buy American statute should submit the request to the

Contracting Officer in time to allow a determination before submission of offers . The Offeror shall

include the information and applicable supporting data required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of FAR

clause [52.225-23](/part-52/52.225-23)  in the request. If an Offeror has not requested a determination regarding the

inapplicability of section 1605 of the Recovery Act or the Buy American statute before submitting its

offer, or has not received a response to a previous request, the Offeror shall include the information

and supporting data in the offer.

(c) Evaluation of offers .

(1) If the Government determines that an exception based on unreasonable cost of domestic

construction material applies in accordance with FAR [25.604](/part-25/25.604) , the Government will evaluate an offer

requesting exception to the requirements of section 1605 of the Recovery Act or the Buy American

statute by adding to the offered price of the contract-

(i) 25 percent of the offered price of the contract, if foreign manufactured construction

material is included in the offer based on an exception for the unreasonable cost of comparable

manufactured domestic construction material; and

(ii) 20 percent of the cost of foreign unmanufactured construction material included in the

offer based on an exception for the unreasonable cost of comparable domestic unmanufactured

construction material.

(2) If the solicitation specifies award on the basis of factors in addition to cost or price, the

Contracting Officer will apply the evaluation factors as specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this provision

and use the evaluated cost or price in determining the offer that represents the best value to the

Government.

(3) Unless paragraph (c)(2) of this provision applies, if two or more offers  are equal in price,

the Contracting Officer will give preference to an offer that does not include foreign construction

material excepted at the request of the Offeror on the basis of unreasonable cost.

(d) Alternate offers .

(1) When an offer includes foreign construction material, other than Recovery Act designated

country construction material, that is not listed by the Government in this solicitation in paragraph

(b)(3) of FAR clause [52.225-23](/part-52/52.225-23) , the Offeror also may submit an alternate offer based on use of

equivalent domestic or Recovery Act designated country construction material.

(2) If an alternate offer is submitted, the Offeror shall submit a separate Standard Form 1442

for the alternate offer and a separate cost comparison table prepared in accordance with paragraphs

(c) and (d) of FAR clause [52.225-23](/part-52/52.225-23)  for the offer that is based on the use of any foreign construction

material for which the Government has not yet determined an exception applies.

(3) If the Government determines that a particular exception requested in accordance with

paragraph (c) of FAR clause [52.225-23](/part-52/52.225-23)  does not apply, the Government will evaluate only those

offers  based on use of the equivalent domestic or Recovery Act designated country construction

material, and the Offeror shall be required to furnish such domestic or Recovery Act designated

country construction material. An offer based on use of the foreign construction material for which

an exception was requested-

(i) Will be rejected as nonresponsive if this acquisition is conducted by sealed bidding; or

(ii) May be accepted if revised during negotiations.
