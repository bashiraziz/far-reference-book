# 52.237-10 Identification of Uncompensated Overtime

As prescribed in [37.115-3](/part-37/37.115-3)  , insert the following provision:

Identification of Uncompensated Overtime (Mar 2015)

(a) Definitions . As used in this provision-

Adjusted hourly rate (including uncompensated overtime)  is the rate that results from

multiplying the hourly rate for a 40-hour work week by 40, and then dividing by the proposed hours

per week which includes uncompensated overtime hours over and above the standard 40-hour work

week. For example, 45 hours proposed on a 40-hour work week basis at $20 per hour would be

converted to an uncompensated overtime rate of $[17.78](/part-17/17.78) per hour ($[20.00](/part-20/20.00) x 40 divided by 45 =

$[17.78](/part-17/17.78)).

Uncompensated overtime  means the hours worked without additional compensation in excess of

an average of 40 hours per week by direct charge employees who are exempt from the Fair Labor

Standards Act. Compensated personal absences such as holidays, vacations, and sick leave shall be

included in the normal work week for purposes of computing uncompensated overtime hours.

(b)

(1) Whenever there is uncompensated overtime, the adjusted hourly rate (including uncompensated

overtime), rather than the hourly rate, shall be applied to all proposed hours, whether regular or

overtime hours.

(2) All proposed labor hours subject to the adjusted hourly rate (including uncompensated

overtime) shall be identified as either regular or overtime hours, by labor categories, and described

at the same level of detail. This is applicable to all proposals whether the labor hours are at the

prime or subcontract level. This includes uncompensated overtime hours that are in indirect cost

pools for personnel whose regular hours are normally charged direct.

(c) The offeror’s accounting practices used to estimate uncompensated overtime must be

consistent with its cost accounting practices used to accumulate and report uncompensated

overtime hours.

(d) Proposals that include unrealistically low labor rates, or that do not otherwise demonstrate

cost realism, will be considered in a risk assessment and will be evaluated for award in accordance

with that assessment.

(e) The offeror shall include a copy of its policy addressing uncompensated overtime with its

proposal.

(End of provision)
