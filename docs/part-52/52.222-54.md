# 52.222-54 Employment Eligibility Verification

As prescribed in 22.1803  , Insert the following clause:

Employment Eligibility Verification (May 2022)

(a) Definitions . As used in this clause-

Commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) item —

(1) Means any item of supply that is—

(i) A commercial product (as defined in paragraph (1) of the definition of “commercial

product” at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 2.101 );

(ii) Sold in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace; and

(iii) Offered to the Government, without modification, in the same form in which it is sold

in the commercial marketplace; and

(2) Does not include bulk cargo, as defined in 46 U.S.C. 40102(4) , such as agricultural

products and petroleum products. Per 46 CFR 525.1  (c)(2), "bulk cargo" means cargo that is loaded

and carried in bulk onboard ship without mark or count, in a loose unpackaged form, having

homogenous characteristics. Bulk cargo loaded into intermodal equipment, except LASH or Seabee

barges, is subject to mark and count and, therefore, ceases to be bulk cargo.

Employee assigned to the contract  means an employee who was hired after November 6, 1986

(after November 27, 2009 in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands), who is directly

performing work, in the United States, under a contract that is required to include the clause

prescribed at 22.1803 . An employee is not considered to be directly performing work under a

contract if the employee-

(1) Normally performs support work, such as indirect or overhead functions; and

(2) Does not perform any substantial duties applicable to the contract.

Subcontract  means any contract, as defined in 2.101 , entered into by a subcontractor to furnish

supplies or services for performance of a prime contract or a subcontract. It includes but is not

limited to purchase orders , and changes and modifications to purchase orders .

Subcontractor  means any supplier, distributor, vendor, or firm that furnishes supplies or services

to or for a prime Contractor or another subcontractor.

United States , as defined in 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(38) , means the 50 States, the District of Columbia,

Puerto Rico, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

(iii) Verify employees assigned to the contract . For each employee assigned to the

performing under a takeover agreement entered into with a Federal agency pursuant to a

requirements at (b)(1) or (b)(2) respectively, except that any requirement for verification of new

employees applies only to new employees assigned to the contract.

(4) Option to verify employment eligibility of all employees . The Contractor may elect to verify
