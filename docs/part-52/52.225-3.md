Bahrainian, Moroccan, Omani, Panamanian, or Peruvian end product  means an article that—

(1) Is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of Bahrain, Morocco, Oman, Panama, or

Peru; or

(2) In the case of an article that consists in whole or in part of materials from another

country, has been substantially transformed in Bahrain, Morocco, Oman, Panama, or Peru into a new

and different article of commerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the article or

articles from which it was transformed. The term refers to a product offered for purchase under a

supply contract, but for purposes of calculating the value of the end product includes services

(except transportation services) incidental to the article, provided that the value of those incidental

services does not exceed that of the article itself.

Commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) item —

(1) Means any item of supply (including construction material) that is-

(i) A commercial product (as defined in paragraph (1) of the definition of “commercial

product” at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 2.101 );

(ii) Sold in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace; and

(iii) Offered to the Government, under a contract or subcontract at any tier, without

modification, in the same form in which it is sold in the commercial marketplace; and

(2) Does not include bulk cargo, as defined in 46 U.S.C. 40102(4), such as agricultural

products and petroleum products.

Component  means an article, material, or supply incorporated directly into an end product.

Cost of components  means—

(1) For components  purchased by the Contractor, the acquisition cost, including

transportation costs to the place of incorporation into the end product (whether or not such costs

are paid to a domestic firm), and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is

issued); or

(2) For components  manufactured by the Contractor, all costs associated with the

manufacture of the component, including transportation costs as described in paragraph (1) of this

definition, plus allocable overhead costs, but excluding profit. Cost of components  does not include

any costs associated with the manufacture of the end product.

Critical component  means a component that is mined, produced, or manufactured in the United

States and deemed critical to the U.S. supply chain. The list of critical components  is at FAR 25.105 .

Domestic end product  means—

(1) For an end product that does not consist wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a

combination of both–

(i) An unmanufactured end product mined or produced in the United States;

(ii) An end product manufactured in the United States, if—

(A)The cost of its components  mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States

exceeds 60 percent of the cost of all its components , except that the percentage will be 65 percent

for items delivered in calendar years 2024 through 2028 and 75 percent for items delivered starting

in calendar year 2029. Components  of foreign origin of the same class or kind as those that the

agency determines are not mined, produced, or manufactured in sufficient and reasonably available

commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality are treated as domestic. Components  of unknown

origin are treated as foreign. Scrap generated, collected, and prepared for processing in the United

States is considered domestic; or

(B) The end product is a COTS item; or

(2) For an end product that consists wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination

of both, an end product manufactured in the United States, if the cost of foreign iron and steel

constitutes less than 5 percent of the cost of all the components  used in the end product. The cost of

foreign iron and steel includes but is not limited to the cost of foreign iron or steel mill products

(such as bar, billet, slab, wire, plate, or sheet), castings, or forgings utilized in the manufacture of

the end product and a good faith estimate of the cost of all foreign iron or steel components

excluding COTS fasteners . Iron or steel components  of unknown origin are treated as foreign. If the

end product contains multiple components , the cost of all the materials used in such end product is

calculated in accordance with the definition of "cost of components ".

End product  means those articles, materials, and supplies to be acquired under the contract for

public use.

Fastener  means a hardware device that mechanically joins or affixes two or more objects

together. Examples of fasteners  are nuts, bolts, pins, rivets, nails, clips, and screws.

Foreign end product  means an end product other than a domestic end product.

Foreign iron and steel  means iron or steel products not produced in the United States. Produced

in the United States means that all manufacturing processes of the iron or steel must take place in

the United States, from the initial melting stage through the application of coatings, except

metallurgical processes involving refinement of steel additives. The origin of the elements of the iron

or steel is not relevant to the determination of whether it is domestic or foreign.

articles from which it was transformed. The term refers to a product offered for purchase under a

supply contract, but for purposes of calculating the value of the end product includes services

(except transportation services) incidental to the article, provided that the value of those incidental

services does not exceed that of the article itself.

country, has been substantially transformed in Israel into a new and different article of commerce

transformed.

Predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of both  means that the cost of the iron and steel

content exceeds 50 percent of the total cost of all its components . The cost of iron and steel is the

forgings utilized in the manufacture of the product and a good faith estimate of the cost of iron or

steel components  excluding COTS fasteners .

Steel  means an alloy that includes at least 50 percent iron, between 0.02 and 2 percent carbon,

and may include other elements.

United States  means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and outlying areas.

foreign articles that the Contracting Officer will treat as domestic for this contract.

these trade agreements apply to all items in the Schedule. The Contractor shall deliver under this

contract only domestic end products  except to the extent that, in its offer, it specified delivery of
