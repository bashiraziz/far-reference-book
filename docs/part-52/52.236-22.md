# 52.236-22 Design Within Funding Limitations

As prescribed in 36.609-1 (c), insert the following clause:

Design Within Funding Limitations (Apr 1984)

(a) The Contractor shall accomplish the design services required under this contract so as to

permit the award of a contract, using standard Federal Acquisition Regulation procedures for the

construction of the facilities designed at a price that does not exceed the estimated construction

contract price as set forth in paragraph (c) of this clause. When bids or proposals for the

construction contract are received that exceed the estimated price, the contractor shall perform

such redesign and other services as are necessary to permit contract award within the funding

limitation. These additional services shall be performed at no increase in the price of this contract.

However, the Contractor shall not be required to perform such additional services at no cost to the

Government if the unfavorable bids or proposals are the result of conditions beyond its reasonable

control.

(b) The Contractor will promptly advise the Contracting Officer if it finds that the project being

designed will exceed or is likely to exceed the funding limitations and it is unable to design a usable

facility within these limitations. Upon receipt of such information, the Contracting Officer will review

the Contractor’s revised estimate of construction cost. The Government may, if it determines that

the estimated construction contract price set forth in this contract is so low that award of a

construction contract not in excess of such estimate is improbable, authorize a change in scope or

materials as required to reduce the estimated construction cost to an amount within the estimated

construction contract price set forth in paragraph (c) of this clause, or the Government may adjust

such estimated construction contract price. When bids or proposals are not solicited or are

unreasonably delayed, the Government shall prepare an estimate of constructing the design

submitted and such estimate shall be used in lieu of bids or proposals to determine compliance with

the funding limitation.

(c) The estimated construction contract price for the project described in this contract is $ ______ .
