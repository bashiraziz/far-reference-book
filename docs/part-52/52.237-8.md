# 52.237-8 Restriction on Severance Payments to Foreign Nationals

As prescribed in [37.113-2](/part-37/37.113-2) (a), use the following provision:

Restriction on Severance Payments to Foreign Nationals (Aug 2003)

(a) The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), at [31.205-6](/part-31/31.205-6) (g)(6), limits the cost allowability of

severance payments to foreign nationals employed under a service contract performed outside the

United States unless the agency grants a waiver pursuant to FAR [37.113-1](/part-37/37.113-1)  before contract award.

(b) In making the determination concerning the granting of a waiver, the agency will determine

that-

(1) The application of the severance pay limitations to the contract would adversely affect the

continuation of a program, project, or activity that provides significant support services for-

(i) Members of the armed forces stationed or deployed outside the United States; or

(ii) Employees of an executive agency posted outside the United States;

(2) The Contractor has taken (or has established plans to take) appropriate actions within its

control to minimize the amount and number of incidents of the payment of severance pay to

employees under the contract who are foreign nationals; and

(3) The payment of severance pay is necessary in order to comply with a law that is generally

applicable to a significant number of businesses in the country in which the foreign national

receiving the payment performed services under the contract, or is necessary to comply with a

collective bargaining agreement.
