# 52.249-10 Default (Fixed-Price Construction)

As prescribed in [49.504](/part-49/49.504) (c)(1) , insert the following clause:

Default (Fixed-Price Construction) (Apr 1984)

(a) If the Contractor refuses or fails to prosecute the work or any separable part, with the

diligence that will insure its completion within the time specified in this contract including any

extension, or fails to complete the work within this time, the Government may, by written notice to

the Contractor, terminate the right to proceed with the work (or the separable part of the work) that

has been delayed. In this event, the Government may take over the work and complete it by contract

or otherwise, and may take possession of and use any materials, appliances, and plant on the work

site necessary for completing the work. The Contractor and its sureties  shall be liable for any

damage to the Government resulting from the Contractor’s refusal or failure to complete the work

within the specified time, whether or not the Contractor’s right to proceed with the work is

terminated. This liability includes any increased costs incurred by the Government in completing

the- work.

(b) The Contractor’s right to proceed shall not be terminated nor the Contractor charged with

damages under this clause, if-

(1) The delay in completing the work arises from unforeseeable causes beyond the control

and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor. Examples of such causes include-

(i) Acts of God or of the public enemy,

(ii) Acts of the Government in either its sovereign or contractual capacity,

(iii) Acts of another Contractor in the performance of a contract with the Government,

(iv) Fires,

(v) Floods,

(vi) Epidemics,

(vii) Quarantine restrictions,

(viii) Strikes,

(ix) Freight embargoes,

(x) Unusually severe weather, or

(xi) Delays of subcontractors or suppliers at any tier arising from unforeseeable causes

beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of both the Contractor and the

subcontractors or suppliers; and

(2) The Contractor, within 10 days from the beginning of any delay (unless extended by the

Contracting Officer), notifies the Contracting Officer in writing of the causes of delay. The

Contracting Officer shall ascertain the facts and the extent of delay. If, in the judgment of the

Contracting Officer, the findings of fact warrant such action, the time for completing the work shall

be extended. The findings of the Contracting Officer shall be final and conclusive on the parties, but

subject to appeal under the Disputes clause.

(c) If, after termination of the Contractor’s right to proceed, it is determined that the Contractor

was not in default, or that the delay was excusable, the rights and obligations of the parties will be

the same as if the termination had been issued for the convenience of the Government.

(d) The rights and remedies of the Government in this clause are in addition to any other rights

and remedies provided by law or under this contract.
