(b) For these purposes on contracts for construction or dismantling, demolition, or removal of

improvements, the Contractor shall-

(1) Provide appropriate safety barricades, signs, and signal lights;

(2) Comply with the standards issued by the Secretary of Labor at 29 CFR Part 1926  and 29

(3) Ensure that any additional measures the Contracting Officer determines to be reasonably

necessary for the purposes are taken.

(c) If this contract is for construction or dismantling, demolition or removal of improvements

with any Department of Defense agency or component, the Contractor shall comply with all

pertinent provisions of the latest version of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Safety and Health

Requirements Manual, EM 385-1-1, in effect on the date of the solicitation.

(d) Whenever the Contracting Officer becomes aware of any noncompliance with these

requirements or any condition which poses a serious or imminent danger to the health or safety of

the public or Government personnel, the Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor orally, with

written confirmation, and request immediate initiation of corrective action. This notice, when

delivered to the Contractor or the Contractor’s representative at the work site, shall be deemed

sufficient notice of the noncompliance and that corrective action is required. After receiving the

notice, the Contractor shall immediately take corrective action. If the Contractor fails or refuses to

promptly take corrective action, the Contracting Officer may issue an order stopping all or part of

the work until satisfactory corrective action has been taken. The Contractor shall not be entitled to

any equitable adjustment of the contract price or extension of the performance schedule on any stop

work order issued under this clause.

changes in the designation of the parties, in subcontracts.

hazardous materials or operations that might endanger the safety of the public and/or Government

personnel or property, add the following paragraph (f) to the basic clause:

(f) Before commencing the work, the Contractor shall-

(1) Submit a written proposed plan for implementing this clause. The plan shall include an analysis

of the significant hazards to life, limb, and property inherent in contract work performance and a

plan for controlling these hazards; and

(2) Meet with representatives of the Contracting Officer to discuss and develop a mutual

understanding relative to administration of the overall safety program.
