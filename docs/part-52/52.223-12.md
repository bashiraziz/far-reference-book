# 52.223-12 Maintenance, Service, Repair, or Disposal of Refrigeration Equipment and Air

Conditioners.

As prescribed in [23.804](/part-23/23.804) (a)(2) , insert the following clause:

Maintenance, Service, Repair, or Disposal of Refrigeration Equipment and Air Conditioners (Jun

2016)

(a) Definitions . As used in this clause–

Global warming potential  means how much a given mass of a chemical contributes to global

warming over a given time period compared to the same mass of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide’s

global warming potential is defined as [1.0](/part-1/1.0).

High global warming potential hydrofluorocarbons  means any hydrofluorocarbons in a

particular end use for which EPA’s Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) program has

identified other acceptable alternatives that have lower global warming potential. The SNAP list of

alternatives is found at 40 CFR Part 82  subpart G with supplemental tables of alternatives available

at (http://www.epa.gov/snap/ ).

Hydrofluorocarbons  means compounds that only contain hydrogen, fluorine, and carbon.

(b) The Contractor shall comply with the applicable requirements of Sections608 and 609 of the

Clean Air Act ( 42 U.S.C.7671g  and 7 671h ) as each or both apply to this contract.

(c) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Contractor shall reduce the use, release, or

emissions of high global warming potential hydrofluorocarbons under this contract by–

(1) Transitioning over time to the use of another acceptable alternative in lieu of high global

warming potential hydrofluorocarbons in a particular end use for which EPA’s SNAP program has

identified other acceptable alternatives that have lower global warming potential;

(2) Preventing and repairing refrigerant leaks through service and maintenance during

contract performance;

(3) Implementing recovery, recycling, and responsible disposal programs that avoid release or

emissions during equipment service and as the equipment reaches the end of its useful life; and

(4) Using reclaimed hydrofluorocarbons, where feasible.

(d) For equipment and appliances that normally each contain 50 or more pounds of

hydrofluorocarbons or refrigerant blends containing hydrofluorocarbons, that will be maintained,

serviced, repaired, or disposed under this contract, the Contractor shall–

(1) Track on an annual basis, between October 1 and September 30, the amount in pounds of

hydrofluorocarbons or refrigerant blends containing hydrofluorocarbons added or taken out of

equipment or appliances under this contract by–

(i) Type of hydrofluorocarbon (e.g., HFC-134 a, HFC-125, R-410 A, R-404 A, etc.);

(ii) Contract number;

(iii) Equipment/appliance; and

(2) Report that information to the Contracting Officer for FY16 and to www.sam.gov , for FY17

and after–

(i) No later than November 30 of each year during contract performance; and

(ii) At the end of contract performance.

(e) The Contractor shall refer to EPA’s SNAP program to identify alternatives. The SNAP list of

alternatives is found at 40 CFR part 82  subpart G with supplemental tables available at

http://www.epa.gov/snap/ .
