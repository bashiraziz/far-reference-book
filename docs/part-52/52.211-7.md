# 52.211-7 Alternatives to Government-Unique Standards

As prescribed in 11.107 (b), insert the following provision:

Alternatives to Government-Unique Standards (Nov 1999)

(a) This solicitation includes Government-unique standards. The offeror may propose voluntary

consensus standards that meet the Government’s requirements as alternatives to the Government-

unique standards. The Government will accept use of the voluntary consensus standard instead of

the Government-unique standard if it meets the Government’s requirements unless inconsistent with

law or otherwise impractical.

(b) If an alternative standard is proposed, the offeror must furnish data and/or information

regarding the alternative in sufficient detail for the Government to determine if it meets the

Government’s requirements. Acceptance of the alternative standard is a unilateral decision made

solely at the discretion of the Government.

(c) Offers  that do not comply with the Government-unique standards specified in this solicitation

may be determined to be nonresponsive or unacceptable. The offeror may submit an offer that

complies with the Government-unique standards specified in this solicitation, in addition to any

proposed alternative standard(s).

(End of provision)
