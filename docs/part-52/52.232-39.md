# 52.232-39 Unenforceability of Unauthorized Obligations

As prescribed in [32.706-3](/part-32/32.706-3)  , insert the following clause:

Unenforceability of Unauthorized Obligations (Jun 2013)

(a) Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under

this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or

similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to

indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or

liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall

govern:

(1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.

(2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have

agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or

agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I

agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements),

execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.

(3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument

or agreement.

(b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is

expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and

procedures.

(End of clause)
