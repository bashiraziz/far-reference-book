As prescribed in [49.503](/part-49/49.503) (b), insert the following clause in solicitations  and contracts for architect-

engineer services when a fixed-price contract is contemplated:

Termination (Fixed-Price Architect-Engineer) (Apr 1984)

(a) The Government may terminate this contract in whole or, from time to time, in part, for the

Government’s convenience or because of the failure of the Contractor to fulfill the contract

obligations. The Contracting Officer shall terminate by delivering to the Contractor a Notice of

Termination specifying the nature, extent, and effective date of the termination. Upon receipt of the

notice, the Contractor shall-

(1) Immediately discontinue all services affected (unless the notice directs otherwise); and

(2) Deliver to the Contracting Officer all data, drawings, specifications, reports, estimates,

summaries, and other information and materials accumulated in performing this contract, whether

completed or in process.

(b) If the termination is for the convenience of the Government, the Contracting Officer shall

make an equitable adjustment in the contract price but shall allow no anticipated profit on

unperformed services.

(c) If the termination is for failure of the Contractor to fulfill the contract obligations, the

Government may complete the work by contract or otherwise and the Contractor shall be liable for

any additional cost incurred by the Government.

(d) If, after termination for failure to fulfill contract obligations, it is determined that the

Contractor had not failed, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the

termination had been issued for the convenience of the Government.

(e) The rights and remedies of the Government provided in this clause are in addition to any

other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.

(End of clause)
