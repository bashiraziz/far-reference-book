# 52.236-16 Quantity Surveys

As prescribed in 36.516  , the contracting officer may insert the following clause in solicitations  and

contracts when a fixed-price construction contract providing for unit pricing of items and for

payment based on quantity surveys is contemplated:

Quantity Surveys (Apr 1984)

(a) Quantity surveys shall be conducted, and the data derived from these surveys shall be used in

computing the quantities of work performed and the actual construction completed and in place.

(b) The Government shall conduct the original and final surveys and make the computations

based on them. The Contractor shall conduct the surveys for any periods for which progress

payments are requested and shall make the computations based on these surveys. All surveys

conducted by the Contractor shall be conducted under the direction of a representative of the

Contracting Officer, unless the Contracting Officer waives this requirement in a specific instance.

(c) Promptly upon completing a survey, the Contractor shall furnish the originals of all field

notes and all other records relating to the survey or to the layout of the work to the Contracting

Officer, who shall use them as necessary to determine the amount of progress payments. The

Contractor shall retain copies of all such material furnished to the Contracting Officer.

(End of clause)

Alternate I ( Apr1984) . If it is determined at a level above that of the Contracting Officer that it is

impracticable for Government personnel to perform the original and final surveys, and the

Government wishes the Contractor to perform these surveys, substitute the following paragraph (b)

for paragraph (b) of the basic clause:

(b) The Contractor shall conduct the original and final surveys and surveys for any periods for which

progress payments are requested. All these surveys shall be conducted under the direction of a

representative of the Contracting Officer, unless the Contracting Officer waives this requirement in

a specific instance. The Government shall make such computations as are necessary to determine

the quantities of work performed or finally in place. The Contractor shall make the computations

based on the surveys for any periods for which progress payments are requested.
