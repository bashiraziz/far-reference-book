# 52.247-51 Evaluation of Export Offers

As prescribed in [47.305-6](/part-47/47.305-6) (e), insert the following provision:

Evaluation of Export Offers  (Jan 2001)

(a) Port handling and ocean charges-other than DoD water terminals.  Port handling and ocean

charges in tariffs on file with the Bureau of Domestic Regulation, Federal Maritime Commission, or

other appropriate regulatory authorities as of the date of bid opening (or the closing date specified

for receipt of offers ) and which will be effective for the date of the expected initial shipment will be

used in the evaluation of offers .

(b) F.o.b. origin, transportation under Government bill of lading.

(1) Offers  shall be evaluated and awards made on the basis of the lowest laid down cost to the

Government at the overseas port of discharge, via methods and ports compatible with required

delivery dates and conditions affecting transportation known at the time of evaluation. Included in

this evaluation, in addition to the f.o.b. origin price of the item, shall be the inland transportation

costs from the point of origin in the United States to the port of loading, port handling charges at the

port of loading, and ocean shipping costs from the United States port of loading (see paragraph (d)

of this clause) to the overseas port of discharge. The Government may designate the mode of routing

of shipment and may load from other than those ports specified for evaluation purposes.

(2) Offers  shall be evaluated on the basis of shipment through one of the ports set forth in

paragraph (d) of this clause to the overseas port of discharge. Evaluation shall be made on the basis

of shipment through the port that will result in the lowest cost to the Government.

(3) Ports of loading shall be considered as destinations within the meaning of the term "f.o.b.

destination" as that term is used in the F.o.b. Origin clause of this contract.

(c) F.o.b. port of loading with inspection and acceptance at origin.

(1) Offers  shall be evaluated on the basis of the lowest laid down cost to the Government at the

overseas port of discharge via methods compatible with required delivery dates and conditions

affecting transportation known at the time of evaluation. Included in this evaluation, in addition to

the price to the United States port of loading (see paragraph (c)(2) of this clause), shall be the port

handling charges at the port of loading and the ocean shipping cost from the port of loading (see

paragraph (d) of this clause) to the overseas port of dis-charge.

(2) Unless offers  are applicable only to f.o.b. origin delivery under Government bills of lading

(see paragraph (b) of this provision), offerors  shall designate below at least one of the ports of

loading listed in paragraph (d) of this clause as their place of delivery. Failure to designate at least

one of the ports as the point to which delivery will be made by the Contractor may render the offer

nonresponsive.

Place of Delivery: ________________________________ [ Offerors  insert at least one of the ports

listed in paragraph (d) of this clause. ]

(d) Ports of loading for evaluation of offers . Terminals to be used by the Government in

evaluating offers  are as follows: (For the information of the offerors , ocean and port handling

(e) Ports of loading nominated by offeror.  The ports of loading named in paragraph (d) of this

clause are considered by the Government to be appropriate for this solicitation due to their

compatibility with methods and facilities required to handle the cargo and types of vessels and to

meet the required overseas delivery dates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, offerors  may nominate

additional ports of loading that the offeror considers to be more favorable to the Government. The

Government may disregard such nominated ports if, after considering the quantity and nature of the

supplies concerned, the requisite cargo handling capability, the available sailings on U.S.-flag

vessels, and other pertinent transportation factors, it determines that use of the nominated ports is

not compatible with the required overseas delivery date. United States Great Lakes ports of loading

may be considered in the evaluation of offers  only for those items scheduled in this provision for

delivery during the ice-free or navigable period as proclaimed by the authorities of the St. Lawrence

Seaway (normal period is between April 15 and November 30 annually). All ports named, including

those nominated by offerors  and determined to be eligible as provided in this provision, shall be

considered in evaluating all offers  received in order to establish the lowest laid down cost to the

Government at the overseas port of discharge. All determinations shall be based on availability of

ocean services by U.S.-flag vessels only. Additional U.S. port(s) of loading nominated by offeror, if

any:

(f) Price basis.  Offeror shall indicate whether prices are based on-

□ Paragraph (e), f.o.b. origin, transportation by GBL to port nominated in paragraph (e); and/or
