# 52.242-17 Government Delay of Work

As prescribed in 42.1305 (c), insert the following clause:

Government Delay of Work (Apr 1984)

(a) If the performance of all or any part of the work of this contract is delayed or interrupted

(1)by an act of the Contracting Officer in the administration of this contract that is not expressly or

impliedly authorized by this contract, or (2)by a failure of the Contracting Officer to act within the

time specified in this contract, or within a reasonable time if not specified, an adjustment (excluding

profit) shall be made for any increase in the cost of performance of this contract caused by the delay

or interruption and the contract shall be modified in writing accordingly. Adjustment shall also be

made in the delivery or performance dates and any other contractual term or condition affected by

the delay or interruption. However, no adjustment shall be made under this clause for any delay or

interruption to the extent that performance would have been delayed or interrupted by any other

cause, including the fault or negligence of the Contractor, or for which an adjustment is provided or

excluded under any other term or condition of this contract.

(b) A claim under this clause shall not be allowed-

(1) For any costs incurred more than 20 days before the Contractor shall have notified the

Contracting Officer in writing of the act or failure to act involved; and

(2) Unless the claim, in an amount stated, is asserted in writing as soon as practicable after

the termination of the delay or interruption, but not later than the day of final payment under the

contract.
