Contracting Officer (see [32.607-2](/part-32/32.607-2) ).

(2) The date of issuance of a Government check to the Contractor from which an amount

otherwise payable has been withheld as a credit against the contract debt; or

(3) The date on which an amount withheld and applied to the contract debt would otherwise

have become payable to the Contractor.
