unmodified item from the original manufacturer, or a source with the express written authority of

conditions for individuals using, maintaining, or depending upon the supplies or services; or is likely

to prevent performance of a vital agency mission.

Design activity  means an organization, Government or contractor, that has responsibility for the

design and configuration of an item, including the preparation or maintenance of design documents.

Design activity could be the original organization, or an organization to which design responsibility
