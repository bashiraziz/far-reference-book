time off policy satisfies the requirements of E.O. 13706 and 29 CFR Part 13  as described in 29 CFR

[13.5](/part-13/13.5)(f)(5), leave shall be designated in records as paid sick leave pursuant to E.O. 13706).

provided by an employee.

(2)

(i) If the Contractor wishes to distinguish between an employee’s covered and noncovered work, the

Contractor shall keep records or other proof reflecting such distinctions. Only if the Contractor

adequately segregates the employee's time will time spent on noncovered work be excluded from

hours worked counted toward the accrual of paid sick leave. Similarly, only if the Contractor

adequately segregates the employee's time may the Contractor properly refuse an employee's

request to use paid sick leave on the ground that the employee was scheduled to perform

noncovered work during the time he or she asked to use paid sick leave.

(ii) If the Contractor estimates covered hours worked by an employee who performs work

in connection with contracts covered by the E.O. pursuant to 29 CFR [13.5](/part-13/13.5)(a)(i) or (iii), the

Contractor shall keep records or other proof of the verifiable information on which such estimates

are reasonably based. Only if the Contractor relies on an estimate that is reasonable and based on

verifiable information will an employee's time spent in connection with noncovered work be

excluded from hours worked counted toward the accrual of paid sick leave. If the Contractor

estimates the amount of time an employee spends performing in connection with contracts covered

by the E.O., the Contractor shall permit the employee to use his or her paid sick leave during any

work time for the Contractor.

(3) In the event the Contractor is not obligated by the Service Contract Labor Standards

statute, the Wage Rate Requirements (Construction) statute, or the Fair Labor Standards Act to

keep records of an employee's hours worked, such as because the employee is exempt from the Fair

Labor Standards Act's minimum wage and overtime requirements, and the Contractor chooses to

use the assumption permitted by 29 CFR [13.5](/part-13/13.5)(a)(1)(iii), the Contractor is excused from the

requirement in paragraph (i)(1)(iv) of this clause and 29 CFR [13.25](/part-13/13.25)(a)(4)  to keep records of the

employee's number of daily and weekly hours worked.

(4)

(i) Records relating to medical histories or domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking, created for

purposes of E.O. 13706, whether of an employee or an employee's child, parent, spouse, domestic

partner, or other individual related by blood or affinity whose close association with the employee is

the equivalent of a family relationship, shall be maintained as confidential records in separate

files/records from the usual personnel files.

(ii) If the confidentiality requirements of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of

2008 (GINA), section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and/or the Americans with Disabilities

Act (ADA) apply to records or documents created to comply with the recordkeeping requirements in

this contract clause, the records and documents shall also be maintained in compliance with the

confidentiality requirements of the GINA, section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and/or ADA

as described in 29 CFR 1635.9 , 41 CFR 60-741 .23(d), and 29 CFR 1630.14(c)(1) , respectively.

(iii) The Contractor shall not disclose any documentation used to verify the need to use 3

or more consecutive days of paid sick leave for the purposes listed in 29 CFR [13.5](/part-13/13.5)(c)(1)(iv) (as

described in 29 CFR [13.5](/part-13/13.5)(e)(1)(ii)) and shall maintain confidentiality about any domestic abuse,

sexual assault, or stalking, unless the employee consents or when disclosure is required by law.

(5) The Contractor shall permit authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division to

conduct interviews with employees  at the worksite during normal working hours.

(6) Nothing in this contract clause limits or otherwise modifies the Contractor's

recordkeeping obligations, if any, under the Service Contract Labor Standards statute, the Wage

Rate Requirements (Construction) statute, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Family and Medical

Leave Act, E.O. 14026, their respective implementing regulations, or any other applicable law.

(j) Interference/discrimination.

(1) The Contractor shall not in any manner interfere with an employee's accrual or use of paid sick

leave as required by E.O. 13706 or 29 CFR Part 13 . Interference includes, but is not limited to-

(ii) Denying or unreasonably delaying a response to a proper request to use paid sick

leave;

(iii) Discouraging an employee from using paid sick leave;

(iv) Reducing an employee's accrued paid sick leave by more than the amount of such

leave used;

(v) Transferring an employee to work on contracts not covered by the E.O. to prevent the

accrual or use of paid sick leave;

(vi) Disclosing confidential information contained in certification or other documentation

provided to verify the need to use paid sick leave; or

(vii) Making the use of paid sick leave contingent on the employee's finding a replacement

worker or the fulfillment of the Contractor's operational needs.

(2) The Contractor shall not discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any

employee for–

13.

(k) Notice . The Contractor shall notify all employees  performing work on or in connection with a

contract covered by the E.O. of the paid sick leave requirements of E.O. 13706, 29 CFR Part 13 , and

this clause by posting a notice provided by the Department of Labor in a prominent and accessible

place at the worksite so it may be readily seen by employees . Contractors that customarily post

notices to employees  electronically may post the notice electronically, provided such electronic

posting is displayed prominently on any website that is maintained by the Contractor, whether

external or internal, and customarily used for notices to employees  about terms and conditions of

employment.

(l) Disputes concerning labor standards . Disputes related to the application of E.O. 13706 to this

contract shall not be subject to the general disputes clause of the contract. Such disputes shall be

resolved in accordance with the procedures of the Department of Labor set forth in 29 CFR Part 13 .

Disputes within the meaning of this contract clause include disputes between the Contractor (or any

of its subcontractors) and the contracting agency, the Department of Labor, or the employees  or

their representatives.

(m) Subcontracts . The Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause, including this

paragraph (m), in all subcontracts, regardless of dollar value, that are subject to the Service
