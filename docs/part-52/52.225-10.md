As prescribed in 25.1102 (b)(1) , insert the following provision:

Notice of Buy American Requirement-Construction Materials (May 2014)

(a) Definitions . "Commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) item," "construction material,"

"domestic construction material," and "foreign construction material," as used in this provision, are

defined in the clause of this solicitation entitled "Buy American-Construction Materials" (Federal

Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause [52.225-9](/part-52/52.225-9) ).

(b) Requests for determinations of inapplicability . An offeror requesting a determination

regarding the inapplicability of the Buy American statute should submit the request to the

Contracting Officer in time to allow a determination before submission of offers . The offeror shall

include the information and applicable supporting data required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of the

clause at FAR [52.225-9](/part-52/52.225-9)  in the request. If an offeror has not requested a determination regarding the

inapplicability of the Buy American statute before submitting its offer, or has not received a

response to a previous request, the offeror shall include the information and supporting data in the

offer.

(c) Evaluation of offers .

(1) The Government will evaluate an offer requesting exception to the requirements of the Buy

American statute, based on claimed unreasonable cost of domestic construction material, by adding

to the offered price the appropriate percentage of the cost of such foreign construction material, as

specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of the clause at FAR [52.225-9](/part-52/52.225-9) .

(2) If evaluation results in a tie between an offeror that requested the substitution of foreign

construction material based on unreasonable cost and an offeror that did not request an exception,

the Contracting Officer will award to the offeror that did not request an exception based on

unreasonable cost.

(d) Alternate offers .

(1) When an offer includes foreign construction material not listed by the Government in this

solicitation in paragraph (b)(2) of the clause at FAR [52.225-9](/part-52/52.225-9) , the offeror also may submit an

alternate offer based on use of equivalent domestic construction material.

(2) If an alternate offer is submitted, the offeror shall submit a separate Standard Form 1442

for the alternate offer, and a separate price comparison table prepared in accordance with

paragraphs (c) and (d) of the clause at FAR [52.225-9](/part-52/52.225-9)  for the offer that is based on the use of any

foreign construction material for which the Government has not yet determined an exception

applies.

(3) If the Government determines that a particular exception requested in accordance with

paragraph (c) of the clause at FAR [52.225-9](/part-52/52.225-9)  does not apply, the Government will evaluate only those

offers  based on use of the equivalent domestic construction material, and the offeror shall be

required to furnish such domestic construction material. An offer based on use of the foreign

construction material for which an exception was requested-

(i) Will be rejected as nonresponsive if this acquisition is conducted by sealed bidding; or

(ii) May be accepted if revised during negotiations.
