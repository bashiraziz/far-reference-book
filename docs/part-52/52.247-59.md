# 52.247-59 F.o.b. Origin-Carload and Truckload Shipments

As prescribed in [47.305-16](/part-47/47.305-16) (a), insert the following clause in solicitations  and contracts when it is

contemplated that they may result in f.o.b. origin contracts with shipments  in carloads or truckloads.

This will facilitate realistic freight cost evaluations of offers  and ensure that contractors produce

economical shipments  of agreed size.

F.o.b. Origin-Carload and Truckload Shipments  (Apr 1984)

(a) The Contractor agrees that shipment shall be made in carload or truckload lots when the

quantity to be delivered to any one destination in any delivery period pursuant to the contract

schedule of deliveries is sufficient to constitute a carload or truckload shipment, except as may

otherwise be permitted or directed, in writing, by the Contracting Officer.

(b) For evaluation purposes, the agreed weight of a carload or truckload shall be the highest

applicable minimum weight that will result in the lowest freight rate (or per car charge) on file or

published in common carrier tariffs or tenders as of the date of bid opening (or the closing date

specified for receipt of proposals).

(c) For purposes of actual delivery, the agreed weight of a carload or truckload will be the

highest applicable minimum weight that will result in the lowest possible freight rate (or per car

charge) on file or published as of date of shipment.

(d) If the total weight of any scheduled quantity to a destination is less than the highest

carload/truckload minimum weight used for evaluation of offers , the Contractor agrees to ship such

scheduled quantity in one shipment.

(e) The Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any increased costs to the Government

resulting from failure to comply with the above requirements.
