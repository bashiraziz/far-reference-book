# 52.225-21 Required Use of American Iron, Steel, and Manufactured Goods-Buy American

Statute-Construction Materials.

As prescribed in 25.1102 (e), insert the following clause:

Required Use of American Iron, Steel, and Manufactured Goods-Buy American Statute- Construction

Materials  (Jan 2021)

(a) Definitions . As used in this clause-

Component  means an article, material, or supply incorporated directly into a construction

material.

Construction material  means an article, material, or supply brought to the construction site by

the Contractor or a subcontractor for incorporation into the building or work. The term also includes

an item brought to the site preassembled from articles, materials, or supplies. However, emergency

life safety systems, such as emergency lighting, fire alarm, and audio evacuation systems, that are

discrete systems incorporated into a public building or work and that are produced as complete

systems, are evaluated as a single and distinct construction material regardless of when or how the

individual parts or components  of those systems are delivered to the construction site.

Domestic construction material  means the following-

(1) An unmanufactured construction material mined or produced in the United States. (The

Buy American statute applies.)

(2) A manufactured construction material that is manufactured in the United States and, if

the construction material consists wholly or predominantly of iron or steel, the iron or steel was

produced in the United States. (Section 1605 of the Recovery Act applies.)

Foreign construction material  means a construction material other than a domestic construction

material.

Manufactured construction material  means any construction material that is not unmanufactured

construction material.

Steel means an alloy that includes at least 50 percent iron, between [0.02](/part-0/0.02) and 2 percent carbon,

and may include other elements.

United States  means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and outlying areas.

Unmanufactured construction material  means raw material brought to the construction site for

incorporation into the building or work that has not been-

(1) Processed into a specific form and shape; or

(2) Combined with other raw material to create a material that has different properties than

the properties of the individual raw materials.

(b) Domestic preference.

(1) This clause implements-

(i) Section 1605 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act)

(Pub. L. 111-5), by requiring, unless an exception applies, that all manufactured construction

material in the project is manufactured in the United States and, if the construction material

consists wholly or predominantly of iron or steel, the iron or steel was produced in the United States

(produced in the United States means that all manufacturing processes of the iron or steel must take

place in the United States, except metallurgical processes involving refinement of steel additives);

and

(ii) 41 U.S.C chapter 83 , Buy American, by providing a preference for unmanufactured

construction material mined or produced in the United States over unmanufactured construction

material mined or produced in a foreign country.

(2) The Contractor shall use only domestic construction material in performing this contract,

except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this clause.

(3) This requirement does not apply to the construction material or components  listed by the

Government as follows:

____________________________________________________________________________[ Contracting

Officer to list applicable excepted materials or indicate "none" ]

(4) The Contracting Officer may add other foreign construction material to the list in

paragraph (b)(3) of this clause if the Government determines that-

(i) The cost of domestic construction material would be unreasonable;

(A) The cost of domestic manufactured construction material, when compared to the

cost of comparable foreign manufactured construction material, is unreasonable when the

cumulative cost of such material will increase the cost of the contract by more than 25 percent;

(B) The cost of domestic unmanufactured construction material is unreasonable when

the cost of such material exceeds the cost of comparable foreign unmanufactured construction

material by more than 20 percent;

(ii) The construction material is not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United

States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities and of a satisfactory quality;

(iii) The application of the restriction of section 1605 of the Recovery Act to a particular

manufactured construction material would be inconsistent with the public interest or the application

of the Buy American statute to a particular unmanufactured construction material would be

impracticable or inconsistent with the public interest.

(c) Request for determination of inapplicability of section 1605 of the Recovery Act or the Buy

American statute.

(1)

(i) Any Contractor request to use foreign construction material in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)

of this clause shall include adequate information for Government evaluation of the request,

including-

(A) A description of the foreign and domestic construction materials ;

(B) Unit of measure;

(C) Quantity;

(D) Cost;

(E) Time of delivery or availability;

(F) Location of the construction project;

(G) Name and address of the proposed supplier; and

(H) A detailed justification of the reason for use of foreign construction materials  cited

in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this clause.

(ii) A request based on unreasonable cost shall include a reasonable survey of the market

and a completed cost comparison table in the format in paragraph (d) of this clause.

(iii) The cost of construction material shall include all delivery costs to the construction

site and any applicable duty.

(iv) Any Contractor request for a determination submitted after contract award shall

explain why the Contractor could not reasonably foresee the need for such determination and could

not have requested the determination before contract award. If the Contractor does not submit a

satisfactory explanation, the Contracting Officer need not make a determination.

(2) If the Government determines after contract award that an exception to section 1605 of

the Recovery Act or the Buy American statute applies and the Contracting Officer and the

Contractor negotiate adequate consideration, the Contracting Officer will modify the contract to

allow use of the foreign construction material. However, when the basis for the exception is the

unreasonable cost of a domestic construction material, adequate consideration is not less than the

differential established in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this clause.

(3) Unless the Government determines that an exception to section 1605 of the Recovery Act

or the Buy American statute applies, use of foreign construction material is noncompliant with

section 1605 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act or the Buy American statute.

(d) Data . To permit evaluation of requests under paragraph (c) of this clause based on

unreasonable cost, the Contractor shall include the following information and any applicable

supporting data based on the survey of suppliers:
