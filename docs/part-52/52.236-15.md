# 52.236-15 Schedules for Construction Contracts

As prescribed in 36.515  , insert the following clause:

Schedules for Construction Contracts (Apr 1984)

(a) The Contractor shall, within fivedays after the work commences on the contract or another

period of time determined by the Contracting Officer, prepare and submit to the Contracting Officer

for approval three copies of a practicable schedule showing the order in which the Contractor

proposes to perform the work, and the dates on which the Contractor contemplates starting and

completing the several salient features of the work (including acquiring materials, plant, and

equipment). The schedule shall be in the form of a progress chart of suitable scale to indicate

appropriately the percentage of work scheduled for completion by any given date during the period.

If the Contractor fails to submit a schedule within the time prescribed, the Contracting Officer may

withhold approval of progress payments until the Contractor submits the required schedule.

(b) The Contractor shall enter the actual progress on the chart as directed by the Contracting

Officer, and upon doing so shall immediately deliver three copies of the annotated schedule to the

Contracting Officer. If, in the opinion of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor falls behind the

approved schedule, the Contractor shall take steps necessary to improve its progress, including

those that may be required by the Contracting Officer, without additional cost to the Government. In

this circumstance, the Contracting Officer may require the Contractor to increase the number of

shifts, overtime operations, days of work, and/or the amount of construction plant, and to submit for

approval any supplementary schedule or schedules in chart form as the Contracting Officer deems

necessary to demonstrate how the approved rate of progress will be regained.

(c) Failure of the Contractor to comply with the requirements of the Contracting Officer under

this clause shall be grounds for a determination by the Contracting Officer that the Contractor is not

prosecuting the work with sufficient diligence to ensure completion within the time specified in the

contract. Upon making this determination, the Contracting Officer may terminate the Contractor’s

right to proceed with the work, or any separable part of it, in accordance with the default terms of

this contract.
