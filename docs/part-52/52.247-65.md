As prescribed in 47.303-17 (f), insert the following clause:

F.o.b. Origin, Prepaid Freight-Small Package Shipments  (Jan 1991)

(a) When authorized by the Contracting Officer, f.o.b. origin freight shipments  which do not have

a security classification shall move on prepaid commercial bills of lading or other shipping

documents to domestic destinations, including air and water terminals. Weight of individual

shipments  shall be governed by carrier restrictions but shall not exceed 150 pounds by any form of

commercial air or 1,000 pounds by other commercial carriers. The Government will reimburse the

Contractor for reasonable freight charges.

(b) The Contractor shall annotate the commercial bill of lading as required by the clause of this

contract entitled "Commercial Bill of Lading Notations."

(c) The Contractor shall consolidate prepaid shipments  in accordance with procedures

established by the cognizant transportation office. The Contractor is authorized to combine

Government prepaid shipments  with the Contractor’s commercial shipments  for delivery to one or

more consignees and the Government will reimburse its pro rata share of the total freight costs. The

Contractor shall provide a copy of the commercial bill of lading promptly to each consignee.

Quantities shall not be divided into mailable lots for the purpose of avoiding movement by other

modes of transportation.

(d) Transportation charges will be billed as a separate item on the invoice for each shipment

made. A copy of the pertinent bill of lading, shipment receipt, or freight bill shall accompany the

invoice unless otherwise specified in the contract.

(e) Loss and damage claims  will be processed by the Government.
