As prescribed in [32.206](/part-32/32.206) (g), insert the following clause:

Installment Payments for Commercial Products  and Commercial Services  (Nov 2021)

(a) Contractor entitlement to financing payments . The Contractor may request, and the

Government shall pay, a contract financing installment payment as specified in this contract when:

the payment requested is properly due in accordance with this contract; the supplies deliverable or

services due under the contract will be delivered or performed in accordance with the contract; and

there has been no impairment or diminution of the Government’s security under this contract.

(b) Computation of amounts . Installment payment financing shall be paid to the Contractor when

requested for each separately priced unit of supply (but not for services) of each line item in

amounts approved by the Contracting Officer pursuant to this clause.

(1) Number of installment payments for each line item . Each separately priced unit of each

line item is authorized a fixed number of monthly installment payments. The number of installment

payments authorized for each unit of a line item is equal to the number of months from the date of

contract award to the date onemonth before the first delivery of the first separately priced unit of

the line item. For example, if the first scheduled delivery of any separately priced unit of a line item

is 9 months after award of the contract, all separately priced units of that line item are authorized 8

installment payments.

(2) Amount of each installment payment . The amount of each installment payment for each

separately priced unit of each line item is equal to 70 percent of the unit price divided by the

number of installment payments authorized for that unit.

(3) Date of each installment payment.  Installment payments for any particular separately

priced unit of a line item begin the number of months prior to the delivery of that unit that are equal

to the number of installment payments authorized for that unit. For example, if 8 installment

payments are authorized for each separately priced unit of a line item, the first installment payment

for any particular unit of that line item would be 8 months before the scheduled delivery date for

that unit. The last installment payment would be 1 month before scheduled delivery of a unit.

(4) Limitation on payment . Prior to the delivery payment for a separately priced unit of a line

item, the sum of all installment payments for that unit shall not exceed 70 percent of the price of

that unit.

(c) Contractor request for installment payment . The Contractor may submit requests for payment

of installment payments not more frequently than monthly, in a form and manner acceptable to the

Contracting Officer. Unless otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer, all installment

payments in any month for which payment is being requested shall be included in a single request,

appropriately itemized and totaled.

(d) Dates for payment . An installment payment under this clause is a contract financing payment

under the Prompt Payment clause of this contract, and except as provided in paragraph (e) of this

clause, approved requests shall be paid within 30 days of submittal of a proper request for payment.

(e) Liquidation of installment payments . Installment payments shall be liquidated by deducting

from the delivery payment of each item the total unliquidated amount of installment payments made

for that separately priced unit of that line item. The liquidation amounts for each unit of each line

item shall be clearly delineated in each request for delivery payment submitted by the Contractor.

(f) Security for installment payment financing . In the event the Contractor fails to provide

adequate security as required in this contract, no financing payment shall be made under this

contract. Upon receipt of adequate security, financing payments shall be made, including all

previous payments to which the Contractor is entitled, in accordance with the terms of the contract.

If at any time the Contracting Officer determines that the security provided by the Contractor is

insufficient, the Contractor shall promptly provide such additional security as the Contracting

Officer determines necessary. In the event the Contractor fails to provide such additional security,

the Contracting Officer may collect or liquidate such security that has been provided, and suspend

further payments to the Contractor; the Contractor shall repay to the Government the amount of

unliquidated financing payments as the Contracting Officer at his sole discretion deems repayable.

(g) Special terms regarding termination for cause . If this contract is terminated for cause, the

Contractor shall, on demand, repay to the Government the amount of unliquidated installment

payments. The Government shall be liable for no payment except as provided by the Termination for

Cause paragraph of the clause at Federal Acquisition Regulation [52.212-4](/part-52/52.212-4) , Contract Terms and

Conditions— Commercial Products  and Commercial Services .

this clause shall-

(i) Excuse the Contractor from performance of obligations under this contract; or

(ii) Constitute a waiver of any of the rights or remedies of the parties under the contract.

(2) The Government’s rights and remedies under this clause-

(i) Shall not be exclusive, but rather shall be in addition to any other rights and remedies

provided by law or this contract; and

(ii) Shall not be affected by delayed, partial, or omitted exercise of any right, remedy,

power, or privilege, nor shall such exercise or any single exercise preclude or impair any further

exercise under this clause or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege of the Government.

(i) Content of Contractor's request for installment payment . The Contractor’s request for

installment payment shall contain the following:

(1) The name and address of the Contractor;

(2) The date of the request for installment payment;

(3) The contract number and/or other identifier of the contract or order under which the
