As prescribed in 46.313  , insert the following clause in solicitations  and contracts for dismantling,

demolition, or removal of improvements:

Inspection-Dismantling, Demolition, or Removal of Improvements (Aug 1996)

(a) Unless otherwise designated by the specifications, all workmanship performed under the

contract is subject to Government inspection at all times and places where dismantling or demolition

work is being performed. The Contractor shall furnish promptly, and at no increase in contract price,

all reasonable facilities, labor, and materials necessary for safe and convenient inspection by the

Government. The Government shall perform inspections  in a manner that will not unduly delay the

work.

(b) The Contractor is responsible for damage to property caused by defective workmanship. The

Contractor shall promptly segregate and remove from the premises any unsatisfactory facilities,

materials, and equipment used in contract performance, and promptly replace them with

satisfactory items. If the Contractor fails to proceed at once in a workmanlike manner with

performance of the work or with the correction of defective workmanship, the Government may-

(1) By contract or otherwise, replace the facilities, materials, and equipment or correct the

workmanship and charge the cost to the Contractor; and

(2) Terminate for default the Contractor’s right to proceed. The Contractor and any surety

shall be liable, to the extent specified in the contract for any damage or cost of repair or

replacement.
