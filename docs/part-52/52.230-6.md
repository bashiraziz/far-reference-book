# 52.230-6 Administration of Cost Accounting Standards

As prescribed in [30.201-4](/part-30/30.201-4) (d)(1) , insert the following clause:

Administration of Cost Accounting Standards (June 2010)

For the purpose of administering the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) requirements under this

contract, the Contractor shall take the steps outlined in paragraphs (b) through (i) and (k) through

(n) of this clause:

(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-

Affected CAS-covered contract or subcontract  means a contract or subcontract subject to CAS

rules and regulations for which a Contractor or subcontractor-

(1) Used one cost accounting practice to estimate costs and a changed cost accounting

practice to accumulate and report costs under the contract or subcontract; or

(2) Used a noncompliant practice for purposes of estimating or accumulating and reporting

costs under the contract or subcontract.

Cognizant Federal agency official (CFAO)  means the Contracting Officer assigned by the

cognizant Federal agency to administer the CAS.

Desirable change  means a compliant change to a Contractor’s established or disclosed cost

accounting practices that the CFAO finds is desirable and not detrimental to the Government and is,

therefore, not subject to the no increased cost prohibition provisions of CAS-covered contracts and

subcontracts affected by the change.

Fixed-price contracts and subcontracts  means-

(1) Fixed-price contracts and subcontracts described at FAR [16.202](/part-16/16.202) , [16.203](/part-16/16.203) , (except when

price adjustments are based on actual costs of labor or material, described at [16.203-1](/part-16/16.203-1) (a)(2)), and

[16.207](/part-16/16.207) ;

(2) Fixed-price incentive contracts and subcontracts where the price is not adjusted based on

actual costs incurred (FAR subpart  [16.4](/part-16/16.4) );

(3) Orders issued under indefinite-delivery contracts and subcontracts where final payment is

not based on actual costs incurred (FAR subpart  [16.5](/part-16/16.5) ); and

(4) The fixed-hourly rate portion of time-and-materials and labor-hours contracts and

subcontracts (FAR subpart  [16.6](/part-16/16.6) ).

Flexibly-priced contracts and subcontracts  means-

(1) Fixed-price contracts and subcontracts described at FAR [16.203-1](/part-16/16.203-1) (a)(2), [16.204](/part-16/16.204) , [16.205](/part-16/16.205) ,

and [16.206](/part-16/16.206) ;

(2) Cost-reimbursement contracts and subcontracts (FAR subpart  [16.3](/part-16/16.3) );

(3) Incentive contracts and subcontracts where the price may be adjusted based on actual

costs incurred (FAR subpart  [16.4](/part-16/16.4) );

(4) Orders issued under indefinite-delivery contracts and subcontracts where final payment is

based on actual costs incurred (FAR subpart  [16.5](/part-16/16.5) ); and

(5) The materials portion of time-and-materials contracts and subcontracts (FAR subpart

[16.6](/part-16/16.6)).

Noncompliance  means a failure in estimating, accumulating, or reporting costs to-

(1) Comply with applicable CAS; or

(2) Consistently follow disclosed or established cost accounting practices.

Required change  means-

(1) A change in cost accounting practice that a Contractor is required to make in order to

comply with applicable Standards, modifications or interpretations thereto, that subsequently

become applicable to existing CAS-covered contracts or subcontracts due to the receipt of another

CAS-covered contract or subcontract; or

(2) A prospective change to a disclosed or established cost accounting practice when the

CFAO determines that the former practice was in compliance with applicable CAS and the change is

necessary for the Contractor to remain in compliance.

Unilateral change  means a change in cost accounting practice from one compliant practice to

another compliant practice that a Contractor with a CAS-covered contract(s) or subcontract(s) elects

to make that has not been deemed a desirable change by the CFAO and for which the Government

will pay no aggregate increased costs.

(b) Submit to the CFAO a description of any cost accounting practice change as outlined in

paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this clause (including revisions to the Disclosure Statement, if

applicable), and any written statement that the cost impact of the change is immaterial. If a change

in cost accounting practice is implemented without submitting the notice required by this

paragraph, the CFAO may determine the change to be a failure to follow paragraph (a)(2) of the

clause at FAR [52.230-2](/part-52/52.230-2) , Cost Accounting Standards; paragraph (a)(4) of the clause at FAR [52.230-3](/part-52/52.230-3) ,

Disclosure and Consistency of Cost Accounting Practices; paragraph (a)(4) of the clause at FAR
