upon an application that is now or may hereafter be withheld from issue pursuant to a Secrecy Order

under 35 U.S.C.181 ) arising out of the manufacture or delivery of supplies, the performance of

services, or the construction, alteration, modification, or repair of real property (hereinafter referred

to as "construction work") under this contract, or out of the use or disposal by or for the account of

the Government of such supplies or construction work.

(b) This indemnity shall not apply unless the Contractor shall have been informed as soon as

practicable by the Government of the suit or action alleging such infringement and shall have been

given such opportunity as is afforded by applicable laws, rules, or regulations to participate in its

defense. Further, this indemnity shall not apply to—

(1) An infringement resulting from compliance with specific written instructions of the

Contracting Officer directing a change in the supplies to be delivered or in the materials or

equipment to be used, or directing a manner of performance of the contract not normally used by

the Contractor;

(2) An infringement resulting from addition to or change in supplies or components  furnished

or construction work performed that was made subsequent to delivery or performance; or
