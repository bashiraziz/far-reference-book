# 52.232-13 Notice of Progress Payments

As prescribed in  32.502-3 (a), insert the following provision in invitations for bids and requests for

proposals that include a Progress Payments clause:

Notice of Progress Payments (Apr 1984)

The need for customary progress payments conforming to the regulations in subpart  32.5  of the

Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will not be considered as a handicap or adverse factor in the

award of the contract. The Progress Payments clause included in this solicitation will be included in

any resulting contract, modified or altered if necessary in accordance with subsection 52.232-16  and

its Alternate I of the FAR. Even though the clause is included in the contract, the clause shall be

inoperative during any time the contractor’s accounting system and controls are determined by the

Government to be inadequate for segregation and accumulation of contract costs.

(End of clause)
