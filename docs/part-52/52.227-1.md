patent-

(1) Embodied in the structure or composition of any article the delivery of which is accepted

by the Government under this contract; or

(2) Used in machinery, tools, or methods whose use necessarily results from compliance by

the Contractor or a subcontractor with (i) specifications or written provisions forming a part of this

contract or (ii) specific written instructions given by the Contracting Officer directing the manner of

performance. the entire liability to the Government for infringement of a United States patent shall

be determined solely by the provisions of the indemnity clause, if any, included in this contract or

any subcontract hereunder (including any lower-tier subcontract), and the Government assumes

liability for all other infringement to the extent of the authorization and consent hereinabove

granted.

(b) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (b), in all

subcontracts that are expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, as defined in Federal

Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 2.101  on the date of subcontract award. However, omission of this

clause from any subcontract, including those at or below the simplified acquisition threshold, as

defined in FAR 2.101  on the date of subcontract award, does not affect this authorization and

consent.
