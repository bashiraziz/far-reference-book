# 52.211-17 Delivery of Excess Quantities

As prescribed in [11.703](/part-11/11.703) (b), insert the following clause:

Delivery of Excess Quantities (Sept 1989)

The Contractor is responsible for the delivery of each item quantity within allowable variations, if

any. If the Contractor delivers and the Government receives quantities of any item in excess of the

quantity called for (after considering any allowable variation in quantity), such excess quantities will

be treated as being delivered for the convenience of the Contractor. The Government may retain

such excess quantities up to $250 in value without compensating the Contractor therefor, and the

Contractor waives all right, title, or interests therein. Quantities in excess of $250 will, at the option

of the Government, either be returned at the Contractor’s expense or retained and paid for by the

Government at the contract unit price.
