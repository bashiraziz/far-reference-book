the following declaration with respect to all technical data that relate to a major system and that are

delivered or required to be delivered under this contract or that are delivered within 3 years after

acceptance of all items (other than technical data) delivered under this contract unless a different

period is set forth in the contract. The Contracting Officer may release the Contractor from all or

contract concerning such technical data.

(End of declaration)

(2) The Government may, at any time during the period covered by this clause, direct

correction of any deficiencies that are not in compliance with contract requirements. The corrections

shall be made at the expense of the Contractor. Unauthorized markings on data shall not be

considered a deficiency for the purpose of this clause, but will be treated in accordance with

paragraph (e) of the Rights in Data-General clause included in this contract.

(c) Technical data revision.  The Contractor also shall, at the request of the Contracting Officer,

revise technical data that are subject to this clause to reflect engineering design changes made

during the performance of this contract and affecting the form, fit, and function of any item (other

than technical data) delivered under this contract. The Contractor may submit a request for an

equitable adjustment to the terms and conditions of this contract for any revisions to technical data

made pursuant to this paragraph.

(d) Withholding of payment.

(1) At any time before final payment under this contract the Contracting Officer may withhold

payment as a reserve up to an amount not exceeding $100,000 or 5 percent of the amount of this

(ii) Provide the declaration required by paragraph (b)(1) of this clause;

(iii) Make the corrections required by paragraph (b)(2) of this clause; or

(iv) Make revisions requested under paragraph (c) of this clause.

(2) The Contracting Officer may withhold the reserve until the Contractor has complied with

the direction or requests of the Contracting Officer or determines that the deficiencies relating to

delivered data, arose out of causes beyond the control of the Contractor and without the fault or

negligence of the Contractor.

(3) The withholding of any reserve under this clause, or the subsequent payment of the

reserve, shall not be construed as a waiver of any Government rights.
