# 52.232-31 Invitation to Propose Financing Terms

As prescribed in [32.205](/part-32/32.205)  (b) and [32.206](/part-32/32.206)  , insert the following provision:

invitation to Propose Financing Terms (Nov 2021)

(a) The offeror is invited to propose terms under which the Government shall make contract

financing payments during contract performance. The financing terms proposed by the offeror shall

be a factor in the evaluation of the offeror’s proposal. The financing terms of the successful offeror

and the clause, Terms for Financing of Purchases of Commercial Products  and Commercial Services ,

at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) [52.232-29](/part-52/52.232-29) , shall be incorporated in any resulting contract.

(b) The offeror agrees that in the event of any conflict between the terms proposed by the offeror

and the terms in the clause at FAR [52.232-29](/part-52/52.232-29) , Terms for Financing of Purchases of Commercial

Products  and Commercial Services , the terms of the clause at FAR [52.232-29](/part-52/52.232-29)  shall govern.

(c) Because of statutory limitations ( 10 U.S.C.2307(f)  and 41 U.S.C.4505 ), the offeror’s proposed

financing shall not be acceptable if it does not conform to the following limitations:

(1) Delivery payments shall be made only for supplies delivered and accepted, or services

rendered and accepted in accordance with the payment terms of this contract;

(2) Contract financing payments shall not exceed 15 percent of the contract price in advance

of any performance of work under the contract;

(3) The terms and conditions of the contract financing must be appropriate or customary in

the commercial marketplace; and

(4) The terms and conditions of the contract financing must be in the best interests of the

United States.

(d) The offeror’s proposal of financing terms shall include the following:

(1) The proposed contractual language describing the contract financing (see FAR [32.202-2](/part-32/32.202-2)

for appropriate definitions of types of payments); and

(2) A listing of the earliest date and greatest amount at which each contract financing

payment may be payable and the amount of each delivery payment. Any resulting contract shall

provide that no contract financing payment shall be made at any earlier date or in a greater amount

than shown in the offeror’s listing.

(e) The offeror’s proposed prices and financing terms shall be evaluated to determine the cost to

the United States of the proposal using the interest rate and delivery schedule specified elsewhere

in this solicitation.
