between the (* ________________ ) and the New Mexico Taxation and Revenue Department.

(d) The Contractor shall provide Type 15 Nontaxable Transaction Certificates to each vendor in

New Mexico selling tangible personal property to the Contractor for use in the performance of this

the vendor’s liability for the gross receipt taxes and those taxes, which are then passed on to the

Contractor, shall not be reimbursable as an allowable cost by the Government.

(e) The Contractor shall pay the New Mexico compensating user tax for any tangible personal

property which is purchased pursuant to a Nontaxable Transaction Certificate if such property is not

used for Federal purposes.

(f) Out-of-state purchase of tangible personal property by the Contractor which would be

otherwise subject to compensation tax shall be governed by the principles of this clause.

Accordingly, compensating tax shall be due from the contractor only if such property is not used for

Federal purposes.

(g) The (* _______________ ) may receive information regarding the Contractor from the Revenue

Division of the New Mexico Taxation and Revenue Department and, at the discretion of the

(*_________________ ), may participate in any matters or proceedings pertaining to this clause or the

representative nor does it obligate the (* ______________ ) to represent its Contractor.

(h) The Contractor agrees to insert the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (h), in

each subcontract which meets the criteria in 29.401-4 (b)(1) through (3) of the Federal Acquisition

Regulation, 48 CFR Part 29 .

(i) Paragraphs (a) through (h) of this clause shall be null and void should the Agreement referred

to in paragraph (c) of this clause be terminated; provided, however, that such termination shall not

nullify obligations already incurred prior to the date of termination.

[*Insert appropriate agency name in blanks.]
