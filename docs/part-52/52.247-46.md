As prescribed in [47.305-3](/part-47/47.305-3)  (b)(4)(ii), insert the following provision in f.o.b. origin solicitations  when

price evaluation for shipments  from various shipping points is contemplated:

Shipping Point(s) Used in Evaluation of F.o.b. Origin Offers  (Apr 1984)

(a) If more than one shipping point or plant is designated by the offeror and the offeror fails to

indicate the quantity per shipping point or plant before bid opening, the Government will evaluate

the offer on the basis of delivery of the entire quantity from the point or plant where cost of

transportation is most favorable to the Government.

(b) If the offeror, before bid opening (or the closing date specified for receipt of offers ) fails to

indicate any shipping point or plant, the Government will evaluate the offer on the basis of delivery

from the plant at which the contract will be performed, as indicated in the offer. If no plant is

indicated in the offer, the offer will be evaluated on the basis of delivery from the Contractor’s

business address indicated in the offer.

(c) If the offeror uses a shipping point other than that which has been used by the Government

as a basis for the evaluation of offers , any increase of transportation costs shall be borne by the

Contractor and any savings shall revert to the Government.
