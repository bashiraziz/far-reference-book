# 52.211-13 Time Extensions

As prescribed in 11.503 (c), insert the following clause:

Time Extensions (Sept 2000)

Time extensions for contract changes will depend upon the extent, if any, by which the changes

cause delay in the completion of the various elements of construction. The change order granting

the time extension may provide that the contract completion date will be extended only for those

specific elements related to the changed work and that the remaining contract completion dates for

all other portions of the work will not be altered. The change order also may provide an equitable

readjustment of liquidated damages under the new completion schedule.

(End of clause)
