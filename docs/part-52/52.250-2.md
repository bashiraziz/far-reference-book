# 52.250-2 SAFETY Act Coverage Not Applicable

As prescribed in 50.206 (a), insert the following provision:

SAFETY Act Coverage Not Applicable (Feb 2009)

The Government has determined that for purposes of this solicitation the product(s) or service(s)

being acquired by this action are neither presumptively nor actually entitled to a pre-determination

that the products or services are qualified anti-terrorism technologies as that term is defined by the

Support Anti-terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act of 2002 (SAFETY Act), 6 U.S.C.

441-444 . This determination does not prevent sellers of technologies from applying for SAFETY Act

protections in other contexts. Proposals in which either acceptance or pricing is made contingent

upon SAFETY Act designation as a qualified anti-terrorism technology or SAFETY Act certification as

an approved product for homeland security of the proposed product or service will not be considered

for award. See Federal Acquisition Regulation subpart  50.2 .

(End of provision)
