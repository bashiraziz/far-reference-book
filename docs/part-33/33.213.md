# 33.213 Obligation to continue performance

(a) In general, before passage of the Disputes statute, the obligation to continue performance

applied only to claims  arising under a contract. However, the Disputes statute, at 41 U.S.C. 7103(g) ,

authorizes agencies to require a contractor to continue contract performance in accordance with the

contracting officer ’s decision pending a final resolution of any claim  arising under, or relating to, the

contract. (A claim  arising under a contract is a claim  that can be resolved under a contract clause ,

other than the clause at [52.233-1](/part-52/52.233-1) , Disputes, that provides for the relief sought by the claimant;

however, relief for such claim  can also be sought under the clause at [52.233-1](/part-52/52.233-1) . A claim  relating to a

contract is a claim  that cannot be resolved under a contract clause  other than the clause at

[52.233-1](/part-52/52.233-1) .) This distinction is recognized by the clause with its AlternateI (see [33.215](/part-33/33.215) ).

(b) In all contracts that include the clause at [52.233-1](/part-52/52.233-1) , Disputes, with its AlternateI, in the event of a

dispute not arising under, but relating to, the contract, the contracting officer  shall  consider

providing, through appropriate agency procedures, financing of the continued performance;

provided, that the Government’s interest is properly secured.
