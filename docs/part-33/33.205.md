# 33.205 Relationship of the Disputes statute to Pub. L.85-804

(a) Requests for relief under Public Law85-804 ( 50 U.S.C. 1431 -1435 ) are not claims  within the

Disputes statute or the Disputes clause at 52.233-1 , Disputes, and shall  be processed under subpart

50.1, Extraordinary Contractual Actions. However, relief formerly available only under Public

Law85-804; i.e., legal entitlement to rescission or reformation for mutual mistake, is now available

within the authority of the contracting officer  under the Contract Disputes statute and the Disputes

clause. In case of a question whether the contracting officer  has authority to settle or decide specific

types of claims , the contracting officer  should  seek legal advice.

(b) A contractor’s allegation that it is entitled to rescission or reformation of its contract in order to

correct or mitigate the effect of a mistake shall  be treated as a claim  under the Disputes statute. A

contract may be reformed or rescinded by the contracting officer  if the contractor would be entitled

to such remedy or relief under the law of Federal contracts. Due to the complex legal issues likely to

be associated with allegations of legal entitlement, contracting officers  shall  make written decisions,

prepared with the advice and assistance of legal counsel, either granting or denying relief in whole

or in part.

(c) A claim  that is either denied or not approved in its entirety under paragraph (b) of this section

may be cognizable as a request for relief under Public Law85-804 as implemented by subpart  50.1 .

However, the claim  must  first be submitted to the contracting officer  for consideration under the

Disputes statute because the claim  is not cognizable under Public Law85-804, as implemented by

subpart  50.1 , unless other legal authority in the agency concerned is determined to be lacking or

inadequate.
