As used in this part-

Procurement Instrument Identifier (PIID ) means the Government-unique identifier for each

solicitation , contract, agreement, or order. For example, an agency may use as its PIID for

procurement  actions, such as delivery and task orders  or basic ordering agreements, the order or

agreement number in conjunction with the contract number (see 4.1602 ).

Supplementary procurement instrument identifier  means the non-unique identifier for a

procurement  action that is used in conjunction with the Government-unique identifier. For example,

an agency may use as its PIID for an amended solicitation , the Government-unique identifier for a

solicitation  number ( e.g., N0002309R0009) in conjunction with a non-unique amendment number

(e.g., 0001). The non-unique amendment number represents the supplementary PIID.
