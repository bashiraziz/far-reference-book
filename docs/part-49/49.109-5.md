# 49.109-5 Partial settlements

The TCO should  attempt to settle in one agreement all rights and liabilities of the parties under the

contract except those arising from any continued portion of the contract . Generally, the TCO shall

not attempt to make partial settlements covering particular items of the prime contractor’s

settlement proposal . However, when a TCO cannot promptly complete settlement under the

terminated contract, a partial settlement may be entered into if-

(a) The issues on which agreement has been reached are clearly severable from other issues and

(b) The partial settlement will not prejudice the Government’s or contractor’s interests in disposing

of the unsettled part of the settlement proposal .
