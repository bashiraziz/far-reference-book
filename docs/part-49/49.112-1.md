# 49.112-1 Partial payments

(a) General.  If the contract authorizes partial payments on settlement proposals  before settlement, a

prime contractor may request them on the form prescribed in [49.602-4](/part-49/49.602-4)  at any time after submission

of interim or final settlement proposals . The Government will process applications for partial

payments promptly. A subcontractor shall  submit its application through the prime contractor which

shall  attach its own invoice  and recommendations to the subcontractor’s application. Partial

payments to a subcontractor shall  be made only through the prime contractor and only after the

prime contractor has submitted its interim or final settlement proposal . Except for undelivered

acceptable finished products , partial payments shall  not be made for profit or fee claimed under the

terminated portion of the contract . In exercising discretion on the extent of partial payments to be

made, the TCO shall  consider the diligence of the contractor in settling with subcontractors and in

preparing its own settlement proposal .

desired accounting, engineering, or other specialized reviews of the data submitted in support of the

contractor’s settlement proposal . If the reviews and the TCO’s examination of the data indicate that

the requested partial payment is proper, reasonable payments may be authorized in the discretion of

the TCO up to-

the termination date, or later completed with the approval of the TCO (see [49.205](/part-49/49.205) );
