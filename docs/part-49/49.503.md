# 49.503 Termination for convenience of the Government and default

(a) Cost-reimbursement contracts-

(1) General use.  Insert the clause at [52.249-6](/part-52/52.249-6) , Termination (Cost-Reimbursement), in solicitations

and contracts when a cost-reimbursement contract is contemplated, except contracts for research

and development with an educational or nonprofit institution on a no-fee basis.

(2) Construction . If the contract is for construction , the contracting officer  shall  use the clause with

its AlternateI.

(3) Partial payments.  If the contract is with an agency of the U.S. Government or with State, local, or

foreign governments or their agencies, and if the contracting officer  determines that the

requirement to pay interest on excess partial payments is inappropriate, the contracting officer  shall

use the clause with its AlternateII. In such contracts for construction , the contracting officer  shall

use the clause with its AlternateIII.

(4) Time-and-material and labor-hour contracts.  If the contract is a time-and-material or labor-hour

contract, the contracting officer  shall  use the clause with its AlternateIV. If the contract is with an

agency of the U.S. Government or with State, local, or foreign governments or their agencies, and if

the contracting officer  determines that the requirement to pay interest on excess partial payments is

inappropriate, the contracting officer  shall  use the clause with its Alternate  V.

(b) Insert the clause at [52.249-7](/part-52/52.249-7) , Termination (Fixed-Price Architect-Engineer), in solicitations  and

contracts for architect-engineer services , when a fixed-price contract is contemplated.

(c) Subcontracts.  The prime contractor may find the clause at [52.249-6](/part-52/52.249-6) , Termination (Cost-

Reimbursement), suitable for use in cost-reimbursement subcontracts; provided, that the

relationship between the contractor and subcontractor is clearly indicated. Inapplicable conditions

(e.g., paragraphs (e), (j) and (n)) should  be deleted and the period for submitting the subcontractor’s

termination settlement proposal  should  be reduced ( e.g.,6 months).
