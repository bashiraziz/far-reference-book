# 49.305-2 Construction contracts

(a) The percentage of completion basis refers to the contractor’s total effort and not solely to the

actual construction  work. Generally, the effort of a contractor under a cost-reimbursement

construction  or professional services contract can be segregated into factors such as-

(1) Mobilization including organization,

(2) Use of finances,

(3) Contracting  for and receipt of materials,

(4) Placement of subcontracts,

(5) Preparation of shop drawings ,

(6) Work in place performed by own forces,

(7) Supervision of subcontractors’ work,

(8) Job administration, and

(9) Demobilization.

(b) Each of the applicable factors in paragraph (a) of this section shall  be assigned a weighted value

depending on its importance and difficulty. The total weight value of all factors should  be easily

divisible ( e.g., by 100) to determine percentages. The percentage of completion of each factor must

be established based upon the specific facts of each contract. When totaled, the percentage of

completion of each factor applied to the weighted value of each factor results in the overall

percentage of contract completion. The percentage of completion is then applied to the total

contract fee or to the fee applicable to the terminated portion of the contract  to arrive at an

equitable adjustment.
