# 49.402-7 Other damages

(a) If the contracting officer  terminates a contract for default or follows a course of action instead of

termination for default  (see [49.402-4](/part-49/49.402-4) ), the contracting officer  promptly must  assess and demand any

liquidated damages to which the Government is entitled under the contract. Under the contract

clause  at [52.211-11](/part-52/52.211-11) , these damages are in addition to any excess repurchase costs.

(b) If the Government has suffered any other ascertainable damages, including administrative costs,

as a result of the contractor’s default, the contracting officer  must , on the basis of legal advice, take

appropriate action as prescribed in subpart  [32.6](/part-32/32.6)  to assert the Government’s demand for the

damages.
