# 38.101 General

(a) The Federal Supply Schedule program, pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 152(3) , provides Federal agencies

with a simplified process of acquiring commercial supplies  and commercial services  in varying

quantities while obtaining volume discounts. Indefinite-delivery contracts are awarded using

competitive procedures to firms. The firms provide supplies  and services at stated prices for given

periods of time, for delivery within a stated geographic area such as the 48 contiguous states, the

District of Columbia, Alaska, Hawaii, and overseas. The schedule contracting office  issues Federal

Supply Schedule publications that contain a general overview of the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS)

program and address pertinent topics.

(b) Each schedule identifies agencies that are required to use the contracts as primary sources of

supply.

(c) Federal agencies  not identified in the schedules as mandatory users may issue orders under the

schedules. Contractors are encouraged to accept the orders.

(d) Although GSA awards most Federal Supply Schedule contracts, it may authorize other agencies

to award schedule contracts and publish schedules. For example, the Department of Veterans Affairs

awards schedule contracts for certain medical and nonperishable subsistence items.

(e) When establishing Federal Supply Schedules, GSA, or an agency delegated that authority, is

responsible for complying with all applicable statutory and regulatory requirements ( e.g., parts  5 , 6,

and 19). The requirements of parts 5, 6, and 19 apply at the acquisition planning  stage prior to

issuing the schedule solicitation  and, generally, do not apply to orders and BPAs placed under

resulting schedule contracts (except see 8.404  and 8.405-5 ).
