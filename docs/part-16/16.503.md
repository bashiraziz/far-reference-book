(a) Description . A requirements contract provides for filling all actual purchase requirements of

designated Government activities for supplies  or services during a specified contract period (from

one contractor), with deliveries or performance to be scheduled by placing orders with the

contractor.

representation to an offeror  or contractor that the estimated quantity will be required or ordered, or

the estimate from records of previous requirements and consumption, or by other means, and should

base the estimate on the most current information available.

(2) The contract shall  state, if feasible, the maximum limit of the contractor’s obligation to deliver

and the Government’s obligation to order. The contract may also specify maximum or minimum

quantities that the Government may order under each individual order and the maximum that it may

order during a specified period of time.

(b) Application .

Government anticipates recurring requirements but cannot predetermine the precise quantities of

supplies  or services that designated Government activities will need during a definite period.

(2) No requirements contract in an amount estimated to exceed $150 million  (including all options )

may be awarded to a single source unless a determination is executed in accordance with
