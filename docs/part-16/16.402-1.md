# 16.402-1 Cost incentives

(a) Most incentive contracts include only cost incentives, which take the form of a profit or fee

adjustment formula and are intended to motivate the contractor to effectively manage costs. No

incentive contract may provide for other incentives without also providing a cost incentive (or

constraint).

(b) Except for award-fee contracts (see 16.404  and 16.401 (e)), incentive contracts include a target

cost, a target profit or fee, and a profit or fee adjustment formula that (within the constraints of a

price ceiling or minimum and maximum fee) provides that-

(1) Actual cost that meets the target will result in the target profit or fee;

(2) Actual cost that exceeds the target will result in downward adjustment of target profit or fee; and

(3) Actual cost that is below the target will result in upward adjustment of target profit or fee.
