# 16.501-2 General

(a) There are three types of indefinite-delivery contracts: definite-quantity contracts, requirements

contracts, and indefinite-quantity contracts. The appropriate type of indefinite-delivery contract may

be used to acquire supplies  and/or services when the exact times and/or exact quantities of future

deliveries are not known at the time of contract award. Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 3401  and 41 U.S.C.

4101 , requirements contracts and indefinite-quantity contracts are also known as delivery-order

contracts  or task-order contracts .

(b) The various types of indefinite-delivery contracts offer  the following advantages:

(1) All three types permit-

(i) Government stocks to be maintained at minimum levels; and

(ii) Direct shipment  to users.

(2) Indefinite-quantity contracts and requirements contracts also permit-

(i) Flexibility in both quantities and delivery scheduling; and

(ii) Ordering of supplies  or services after requirements materialize.

(3) Indefinite-quantity contracts limit the Government’s obligation to the minimum quantity specified

in the contract.

(4) Requirements contracts may permit faster deliveries when production lead time is involved,

because contractors are usually willing to maintain limited stocks when the Government will obtain

all of its actual purchase requirements from the contractor.

(c) Indefinite-delivery contracts may provide for any appropriate cost or pricing  arrangement under

part  16 . Cost or pricing  arrangements that provide for an estimated quantity of supplies  or services

(e.g., estimated number of labor hours) must  comply with the appropriate procedures of this

subpart.
