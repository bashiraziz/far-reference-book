# 16.301-2 Application

(a) The contracting officer  shall  use cost-reimbursement contracts only when-

(1) Circumstances do not allow the agency to define its requirements sufficiently to allow for a fixed-

price type contract (see [7.105](/part-7/7.105) ); or

(2) Uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit costs to be estimated with

sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed-price contract.

(b) The contracting officer  shall  document the rationale for selecting the contract type in the written

acquisition  plan and ensure that the plan is approved and signed at least one level above the

contracting officer  (see [7.103](/part-7/7.103) (j) and [7.105](/part-7/7.105) ).
