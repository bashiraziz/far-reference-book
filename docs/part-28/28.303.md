# 28.303 Insurance against loss of or damage to Government property.

When the Government requires or approves insurance to cover loss of or damage to Government property (see 45.104, Responsibility and liability for Government property), it may be provided by specific insurance policies or by inclusion of the risks in the contractor’s existing policies. The policies shall disclose the Government’s interest in the property.
