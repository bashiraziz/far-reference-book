# 25.502 (c)(4)(ii)). Note that, if Offer  A were greater than Offer  B, an evaluation factor would not be

applied, and award would be on Offer  C (see 25.502 (c)(3)).

(c) Example 3 .

OFFERS

Item A B C

1 DO = $17,800FO

(>55%)= $16,000FO

(>55%)= $11,200

2FO

(>55%)= $9,000FO

(>55%)= $8,500 DO = $10,200

OFFERS

Item A B C

3FO

(>55%)= $11,200FO

(>55%)= $12,000FO

(>55%)= $11,000

4 DO = $10,000 DO = $9,000FO

(>55%)= $6,400

Total $48,000 $45,500 $38,800.

Key:

DO = Domestic end product  (complies with the required domestic content).

FO > 55% = Foreign end product  with domestic content exceeding 55%.

FO < 55% = Foreign end product  with domestic content of 55% or less.

Problem:  The solicitation  specifies award on a group basis. Assume only the Buy American statute

applies ( i.e., no trade agreements apply) and the acquisition  cannot be set aside for small business

concerns. All offerors  are large businesses.

Analysis:  (see 25.503 (d))

STEP 1:  Determine which of the offers  are domestic (see 25.503 (d)(1)).

Domestic [percent] Determination

A$17,800 ( Offer  A1) + $10,000 ( Offer  A4) = $27,800

$27,800/$48,000 ( Offer  A Total) = 58%Domestic

B $9,000 ( Offer  B4)/$45,500 ( Offer  B Total) = 19.8% Foreign

C $10,200 ( Offer  C2)/$38,800 ( Offer  C Total) = 26.3% Foreign

STEP 2:  Determine which offer , domestic or foreign, is the low offer . If the low offer  is a foreign

offer , apply the evaluation factor (see 25.503(d)(2)). The low offer  (Offer  C) is a foreign offer .

Therefore, apply the factor to the low offer . Addition of the 20 percent factor (use 30 percent if Offer

A is a small business) to Offer  C yields an evaluated price of $46,560 ($38,800 + 20 percent). Offer  C

remains the low offer .

STEP 3:  Determine if there is a foreign offer  that could be treated as a domestic offer  (see
