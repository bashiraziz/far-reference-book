# 25.504-2 WTO GPA/Caribbean Basin Trade Initiative/FTAs

Example 1 .

Offer  A $304,000 U.S.-made end product  (not domestic)

Offer  B $303,000 U.S.-made end product  (domestic), small business

Offer  C $300,000 Eligible product

Offer  D $295,000 Noneligible product  (not U.S.-made)

Analysis : Eliminate Offer  D because the acquisition  is covered by the WTO GPA  and there is an offer

of a U.S.-made or an eligible product  (see 25.502 (b)(1)). If the agency gives the same consideration

given eligible offers  to offers  of U.S.-made end products  that are not domestic offers , it is

unnecessary to determine if U.S.-made end products  are domestic (large or small business). No

further analysis is necessary. Award on the low remaining offer , Offer  C (see 25.502 (b)(2)).
