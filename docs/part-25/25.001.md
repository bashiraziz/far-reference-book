# 25.001 General

(a) 41 U.S.C. chapter 83 , Buy American-

(1) Restricts the purchase of supplies , that are not domestic end products , for use within the United

States . A foreign end product  may be purchased if the contracting officer  determines that the price

of the lowest domestic offer  is unreasonable or if another exception applies (see subpart  [25.1](/part-25/25.1) ); and

(2) Requires, with some exceptions, the use of only domestic construction materials  in contracts for

construction  in the United States  (see subpart  [25.2](/part-25/25.2) ).

(b) The restrictions in the Buy American statute are not applicable in acquisitions  subject to certain

trade agreements (see subpart  [25.4](/part-25/25.4) ). In these acquisitions , end products  and construction materials

from certain countries receive nondiscriminatory treatment in evaluation with domestic offers .

Generally, the dollar value of the acquisition  determines which of the trade agreements applies.

Exceptions to the applicability of the trade agreements are described in subpart  [25.4](/part-25/25.4) .

(c) The test to determine the country of origin for an end product  under the Buy American statute

(see the various country " end product " definitions in [25.003](/part-25/25.003) ) is different from the test to determine

the country of origin for an end product  under the trade agreements, or the criteria for the

representation on end products  manufactured outside the United States  (see [52.225-18](/part-52/52.225-18) ).

(1) The Buy American statute uses a two-part test to define a " domestic end product " or " domestic

construction material " (manufactured in the United States  and a domestic content test). The

domestic content test has been waived for acquisition  of commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS)

items, except a product that consists wholly or predominantly of iron or steel or a combination of

both (excluding COTS fasteners ) (see [25.101](/part-25/25.101) (a) and [25.201](/part-25/25.201) (b)).

(2) Under the trade agreements, the test to determine country of origin is "substantial

transformation" ( i.e., transforming an article into a new and different article of commerce, with a

name, character, or use distinct from the original article).

(3) For the representation at [52.225-18](/part-52/52.225-18) , the only criterion is whether the place of manufacture of an

end product  is in the United States  or outside the United States , without regard to the origin of the

components .

(4) When using funds appropriated under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009

(Pub. L. 111-5), the definition of "domestic manufactured construction material " requires

manufacture in the United States  but does not include a requirement with regard to the origin of the

components . If the construction material  consists wholly or predominantly of iron or steel , the iron

or steel  must  be produced in the United States .
