# 25.504-4 Group award basis

(a) Example 1 .

OFFERS

Item A B C

1 DO = $55,000 EL = $56,000 NEL = $50,000

2 NEL = $13,000 EL = $10,000 EL = $13,000

3 NEL = $11,500 DO = $12,000 DO = $10,000

4 NEL = $24,000 EL = $28,000 NEL = $22,000

5 DO = $18,000 NEL = $10,000 DO = $14,000

$121,500 $116,000 $109,000

Key:

DO = Domestic end product

EL = Eligible product

NEL = Noneligible product

Problem : Offeror  C specifies all-or-none award. Assume all offerors  are large businesses. The

acquisition  is not covered by the WTO GPA .

Analysis : (see 25.503 )

STEP 1 : Evaluate Offers  A & B before considering Offer  C and determine which offer  has the lowest

evaluated cost for each line item  (the tentative award pattern):

Item 1 : Low offer  A is domestic; select A.

Item 2 : Low offer  B is eligible; do not apply factor; select B.

Item 3 : Low offer  A is noneligible and Offer  B is a domestic offer . Apply a 20 percent factor to Offer

A. The evaluated price of Offer  A is higher than Offer  B; select B.

Item 4 : Low offer  A is noneligible. Since neither offer  is a domestic offer , no evaluation factor

applies; select A.

Item 5 : Low offer  B is noneligible; apply a 20 percent factor to Offer  B. Offer  A is still higher than

Offer  B; select B.

STEP 2 : Evaluate Offer  C against the tentative award pattern for Offers  A and B:

TOTAL $113,000 $119,000

*Offer  + 20 percent.

On a line item  basis, apply a factor to any noneligible offer  if the other offer  for that line item  is

domestic.

For Item 1, apply a factor to Offer  C because Offer  A is domestic and the acquisition  was not covered

by the WTO GPA . The evaluated price of Offer  C, Item 1, becomes $60,000 ($50,000 plus 20

percent). Apply a factor to Offer  B, Item 5, because it is a noneligible product  and Offer  C is

domestic. The evaluated price of Offer  B is $12,000 ($10,000 plus 20 percent). Evaluate the

remaining items without applying a factor.

STEP 3: The tentative unrestricted award pattern from Offers  A and B is lower than the evaluated

price of Offer  C. Award the combination of Offers  A and B. Note that if Offer  C had not specified all-

or-none award, award would be made on Offer  C for line items  3 and 4, totaling an award of

$32,000.

(b) Example 2 .

OFFERS

Item A B C

1 DO = $50,000 EL = $50,500 NEL = $50,000

2 NEL = $10,300 NEL = $10,000 EL = $10,200

3 EL = $20,400 EL = $21,000 NEL = $20,200

4 DO = $10,500 DO = $10,300 DO = $10,400

TOTAL $91,200 $91,800 $90,800

Problem:  The solicitation  specifies award on a group basis. Assume the Buy American statute applies

and the acquisition  cannot be set aside for small business concerns. All offerors  are large

businesses.

Analysis:  (see 25.503 (c))

STEP 1: Determine which of the offers  are domestic (see 25.503 (c)(1)):

Domestic [percent] Determination

A$50,000 ( Offer  A1) + $10,500 ( Offer  A4) = $60,500

$60,500/$91,200 ( Offer  A Total) = 66.3%Domestic

B $10,300 ( Offer  B4) /$91,800 ( Offer  B Total) $ = 11.2% Foreign

C $10,400 ( Offer  C4) /$90,800 ( Offer  C Total) = 11.5% Foreign

STEP 2 : Determine whether foreign offers  are eligible or noneligible offers  (see 25.503 (c)(2)):

Domestic + Eligible [percent] Determination

A N/A (Both Domestic) Domestic

B$50,500 ( Offer  B1) + $21,000 ( Offer  B3) + $10,300 ( Offer  B4)=

$81,800.

$81,800 /$91,800 ( Offer  B Total) = 89.1%Eligible

C$10,200 ( Offer  C2) + $10,400 ( Offer  C4) = $20,600.

$20,600/$90,800 ( Offer  C Total) = 22.7%Noneligible

STEP 3:  Determine whether to apply an evaluation factor (see 25.503 (c)(3)). The low offer  (Offer  C)

is a foreign offer . There is no eligible offer  lower than the domestic offer . Therefore, apply the factor

to the low offer . Addition of the 20 percent factor (use 30 percent if Offer  A is a small business) to

Offer  C yields an evaluated price of $108,960 ($90,800 + 20 percent). Award on Offer  A (see
