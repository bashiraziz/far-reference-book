# 25.504-3 FTA/Israeli Trade Act

(a) Example 1 .

Offer  A $105,000 Domestic end product , small business

Offer  B $100,000 Eligible product

Analysis : Since the low offer  is an eligible offer , award on the low offer  (see 25.502 (c)(1)).

(b) Example 2 .

Offer  A $105,000 Eligible product

Offer  B $103,000 Noneligible product

Analysis : Since the acquisition  is not covered by the WTO GPA , the contracting officer  can consider

the noneligible offer . Since no domestic offer  was received, make a nonavailability determination

and award on Offer  B (see 25.502 (c)(2)).

(c) Example 3 .

Offer  A $105,000 Domestic end product , large business

Offer  B $103,000 Eligible product

Offer  C $100,000 Noneligible product

Analysis : Since the acquisition  is not covered by the WTO GPA , the contracting officer  can consider

the noneligible offer . Because the eligible offer  (Offer  B) is lower than the domestic offer  (Offer  A),

no evaluation factor applies to the low offer  (Offer  C). Award on the low offer  (see 25.502 (c)(3)).
