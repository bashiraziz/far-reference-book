# 25.003 ). The cost of foreign iron and steel  includes but is not limited to the cost of foreign iron or

steel  mill products  (such as bar, billet, slab, wire, plate, or sheet), castings, or forgings utilized in the

manufacture of the construction material  and a good faith estimate of the cost of all foreign iron or

steel  components  excluding COTS fasteners . This domestic content test of the Buy American statute

has not been waived for acquisitions  of COTS items in this category, except for COTS fasteners .

(c)

(1) A contract with a period of performance that spans the schedule of domestic content threshold

increases specified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section shall  be required to comply with each

increased threshold for the items in the year of delivery, unless the senior procurement executive  of

the contracting  agency allows for application of an alternate  domestic content test for that contract

under which the domestic content threshold in effect at time of contract award will apply to the

entire period of performance for the contract. This authority is not delegable. The senior

procurement  executive shall  consult the Office of Management and Budget's Made in America Office

before allowing the use of the alternate  domestic content test.

(2) When a senior procurement executive  allows for application of an alternate  domestic content test

for a contract, see 25.1102 (a)(3) or (c)(4) for use of the appropriate Alternate  clause to reflect the

domestic content threshold that will apply to the entire period of performance for that contract.
