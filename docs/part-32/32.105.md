# 32.105 Uses of contract financing.

- (a) Contract financing methods covered in this part are intended to be self-liquidating through contract performance. Consequently, agencies shall only use the methods for financing of contractor working capital, not for the expansion of contractor-owned facilities or the acquisition of fixed assets. However, under loan guarantees, exceptions may be made for- - (1) Facilities expansion of a minor or incidental nature, if a relatively small part of the guaranteed loan is used for the expansion and the contractor’s repayment would not be delayed or impaired; or - (2) Other instances of facilities expansion for which contract financing is appropriate under agency procedures. - (b) The limitations in this section do not apply to contracts under which facilities are being acquired for Government ownership.
