# 32.306 Loan guarantees for subcontracts

If the request for a loan guarantee concerns a subcontractor that is financially weak in comparison

with its contractor, the Government’s interests may be fostered by the contractor making progress

payments to the subcontractor. If so, the agency shall  try to arrange for the contractor to provide

the progress payments. As a result, the need for the loan guarantee may be reduced or eliminated

and the contractor would bear part or all of the risk of loss arising from the selection of the

subcontractor.

Commercial Acquisitions
