# 32.503-11 Adjustments for price reduction

(a) If a retroactive downward price reduction occurs under a redeterminable contract that provides

for progress payments, the contracting officer  shall -

(1) Determine the refund due and obtain repayment from the contractor for the excess of payments

made for delivered items over amounts due as recomputed at the reduced prices; and

(2) Increase the unliquidated progress payments amount for overdeductions made from the

contractor’s billings for items delivered.

(b) The contracting officer  shall  also increase the unliquidated progress payments amount if the

contractor makes an interim or voluntary price reduction under a redeterminable or incentive

contract.
