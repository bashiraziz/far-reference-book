# 32.109 Termination financing

To encourage contractors to invest their own funds in performance despite the susceptibility of the

contract to termination for the convenience of the Government, the contract financing procedures

under this part may be applied to the financing of terminations either in connection with or

independently of financing for contract performance (see [49.112-1](/part-49/49.112-1) ).
