# 32.004 Contract performance in foreign countries

The enforceability of contract provisions for security of Government financing in a foreign

jurisdiction is dependent upon local law and procedure. Prior to providing contract financing where

foreign jurisdictions may become involved, the contracting officer  shall  ensure the Government’s

security is enforceable. This may require the provision of additional or different security than that

normally provided for in the standard contract clauses .
