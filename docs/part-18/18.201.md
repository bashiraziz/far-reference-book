# 18.201 Contingency operation.

- (a) Contingency operation is defined in 2.101. - (b) Micro-purchase threshold. The threshold increases when the head of the agency determines the supplies or services are to be used to support a contingency operation. (See 2.101 and 13.201(g).) - (c) Simplified acquisition threshold. The threshold increases when the head of the agency determines the supplies or services are to be used to support a contingency operation. (See 2.101.) - (d) SF 44, Purchase Order-Invoice-Voucher. The normal threshold for the use of the SF 44 is at or below the micro-purchase threshold. Agencies may, however, establish higher dollar limitations for purchases made to support a contingency operation. (See 13.306.) - (e) Simplified procedures for certain commercial products and commercial services. The threshold limits authorized for use of this authority may be increased for acquisitions to support a contingency operation. (See 13.500(c).)
