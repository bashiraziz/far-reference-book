# 19.804-4 Repetitive acquisitions

In order for repetitive acquisitions  to be awarded through the 8(a) program, there must  be separate

offers  and acceptances. This allows the SBA to determine-

(a) Whether the requirement should  be a competitive 8(a) award;

(b) A nominated 8(a) participant's eligibility, and whether or not it is the same 8(a) participant that

performed the previous contract;

(c) The effect that contract award would have on the equitable distribution of 8(a) contracts; and

(d) Whether the requirement should  continue under the 8(a) program.
