# 19.502-9 Withdrawing or modifying small business set-asides

(a) If, before award of a contract involving a total or partial small business set-aside, the contracting

officer  considers that award would be detrimental to the public interest (e.g., payment of more than

a fair market price ), the contracting officer  may withdraw the small business set-aside, whether it

was unilateral or joint. The contracting officer  shall  initiate a withdrawal of an individual total or

partial small business set-aside, by giving written notice to the agency small business specialist and

the SBA PCR (or, if a PCR is not assigned, see 19.402 (a)) stating the reasons. In a similar manner,

the contracting officer  may modify a unilateral or joint class small business set-aside to withdraw

one or more individual acquisitions .

(b) If the agency small business specialist does not agree to a withdrawal or modification, the case

shall  be promptly referred to the SBA PCR (or, if a PCR is not assigned, see 19.402 (a)) for review.

(c) The contracting officer  shall  prepare a written statement supporting any withdrawal or

modification of a small business set-aside and include it in the contract file.
