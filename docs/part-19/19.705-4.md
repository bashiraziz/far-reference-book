# 19.705-4 Reviewing the subcontracting plan

The contracting officer  shall  review the subcontracting plan for adequacy, ensuring that the

required information, goals, and assurances are included (see [19.704](/part-19/19.704) ).

(a) No detailed standards apply to every subcontracting plan. Instead, the contracting officer  shall

consider each plan in terms of the circumstances of the particular acquisition , including-

(1) Previous involvement of small business concerns  as prime contractors or subcontractors in

similar acquisitions ;

(2) Proven methods of involving small business concerns  as subcontractors in similar acquisitions ;

and

(3) The relative success of methods the contractor intends to use to meet the goals and requirements

of the plan, as evidenced by records maintained by contractors.

(b) If, under a sealed bid solicitation , a bidder submits a plan that does not cover each of the 15

required elements (see [19.704](/part-19/19.704) ), the contracting officer  shall  advise the bidder of the deficiency and

request submission of a revised plan by a specific date. If the bidder does not submit a plan that

incorporates the required elements within the time allotted, the bidder shall  be ineligible  for award.

If the plan, although responsive, evidences the bidder’s intention not to comply with its obligations

under the clause at [52.219-8](/part-52/52.219-8) , Utilization of Small Business Concerns , the contracting officer  may

find the bidder nonresponsible.

(c) In negotiated acquisitions , the contracting officer  shall  determine whether the plan is acceptable

based on the negotiation of each of the 15 elements of the plan (see [19.704](/part-19/19.704) ). Subcontracting goals

should  be set at a level that the parties reasonably expect can result from the offeror  expending

good faith efforts to use small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-

owned small business, HUBZone  small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned

small business subcontractors  to the maximum practicable extent. The contracting officer  shall  take

particular care to ensure that the offeror  has not submitted unreasonably low goals to minimize

exposure to liquidated damages and to avoid the administrative burden of substantiating good faith

efforts. Additionally, particular attention should  be paid to the identification of steps that, if taken,

would be considered a good faith effort (see [19.705-7](/part-19/19.705-7) ). No goal should  be negotiated upward if it is

apparent that a higher goal will significantly increase the Government’s cost or seriously impede the

attainment of acquisition  objectives. An incentive subcontracting clause (see [52.219-10](/part-52/52.219-10) , Incentive

Subcontracting Program), may be used when additional and unique contract effort, such as

providing technical assistance, could significantly increase subcontract  awards to small business,

small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small

business, HUBZone  small business, or women-owned small business concerns .

(d) In determining the acceptability of a proposed subcontracting plan, the contracting officer  should

take the following actions:

(1) Obtain information available from the cognizant contract administration office , as provided for in
