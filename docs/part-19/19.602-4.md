# 19.602-4 Awarding the contract

(a) If new information causes the contracting officer  to determine that the concern  referred to the

SBA is actually responsible to perform the contract, and award has not already been made under

paragraph (c) of this subsection, the contracting officer  shall  reverse the determination of

nonresponsibility, notify the SBA of this action, withdraw the referral, and proceed to award the

contract.

(b) The contracting officer  shall  award the contract to the concern  in question if the SBA issues a

COC after receiving the referral. An SBA-certified concern  shall  not be required to meet any other

requirements of responsibility. SBA COC’s are conclusive with respect to all elements of

responsibility of prospective small business contractors. Where SBA issues a COC, the contracting

officer  may decide not to award to that offeror  for reasons unrelated to responsibility.

(c) The contracting officer  shall  proceed with the acquisition  and award the contract to another

appropriately selected and responsible offeror  if the SBA has not issued a COC within 15 business

days (or a longer period of time agreed to with the SBA) after receiving the referral.
