# 19.805-2 Procedures

(a) Offers  shall  be solicited from those sources identified in accordance with [19.804-3](/part-19/19.804-3) .

(b) The SBA will determine the eligibility of the apparent successful offeror . Eligibility is based on

section 8(a) program criteria (see 13 CFR 124.501(g)  and [19.816](/part-19/19.816) (c)).

(1) In either negotiated or sealed bid competitive 8(a) acquisitions  SBA will determine the eligibility

of the apparent successful offeror  and advise the contracting office  within 5 working days after

receipt of the contracting office 's request for an eligibility determination.

(i) If SBA determines that the apparent successful offeror  is ineligible , the contracting office  will

then send to SBA the identity of the next highest evaluated offeror  for an eligibility determination.

The process is repeated until SBA determines that an identified offeror  is eligible for award.

(ii) If the contracting officer  believes that the apparent successful offeror  (or the offeror  SBA has

determined eligible for award) is not responsible to perform the contract, the contracting officer

must  refer the matter to SBA for Certificate of Competency consideration under subpart [19.6](/part-19/19.6).

(2) For a two-step design-build procurement , an 8(a) participant must  be eligible for award under

the 8(a) program on the initial date for receipt of phase one offers  specified in the solicitation  (see

13 CFR 124.507(d)(3) .

(3) In any case in which an 8(a) participant is determined to be ineligible , SBA will notify the 8(a)

participant of that determination.

(c) Any party with information questioning the eligibility of an 8(a) participant to continue

participation in the 8(a) program or for the purposes of a specific 8(a) award may submit such

information to the SBA in accordance with 13 CFR 124.112(c) .

(d)

(1) SBA does not certify joint ventures, as entities, into the 8(a) program.

(2) A contracting officer  may consider a joint venture for contract award. SBA does not approve joint

ventures for competitive awards (but see 13 CFR 124.501(g)  for SBA's determination of participant

eligibility).
