# 11.002 Policy

(a) In fulfilling requirements of 10 U.S.C. 3206(a) , 10 U.S.C. 3453 , 41 U.S.C. 3306(a) , and 41

U.S.C.3307 , agencies shall -

(1) Specify needs using market research  in a manner designed to-

(i) Promote full and open competition  (see part  6 ), or maximum practicable competition when using

simplified acquisition procedures , with due regard to the nature of the supplies  or services to be

acquired; and

(ii) Only include restrictive provisions or conditions to the extent necessary to satisfy the needs of

the agency or as authorized by law.

(2) To the maximum extent practicable, ensure that acquisition  officials-

(i) State requirements with respect to an acquisition  of supplies  or services in terms of-

(A) Functions to be performed;

(B) Performance required; or

(C) Essential physical characteristics;

(ii) Define requirements in terms that enable and encourage offerors  to supply commercial products

or commercial services  or, to the extent that commercial products  suitable to meet the agency’s

needs are not available, nondevelopmental items , in response to the agency solicitations ;

(iii) Provide offerors  of commercial products , commercial services , and nondevelopmental items  an

opportunity to compete in any acquisition  to fill such requirements;

(iv) Require prime contractors and subcontractors at all tiers under the agency contracts to

incorporate commercial products , commercial services , or nondevelopmental items  as components

of items supplied to the agency; and

(v) Modify requirements in appropriate cases to ensure that the requirements can be met by

commercial products  or commercial services  or, to the extent that commercial products  suitable to

meet the agency’s needs are not available, nondevelopmental items .

(b) The Metric Conversion Act of 1975, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act

of 1988 ( 15 U.S.C. 205a , et seq. ), designates the metric system of measurement as the preferred

system of weights and measures for United States  trade and commerce, and it requires that each

agency use the metric system of measurement in its acquisitions , except to the extent that such use

is impracticable or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies or loss of markets to United States

firms. Requiring activities are responsible for establishing guidance implementing this policy in

formulating their requirements for acquisitions .

(c) To the extent practicable and consistent with subpart  [9.5](/part-9/9.5) , potential offerors  should  be given an

opportunity to comment on agency requirements or to recommend application and tailoring of

requirements documents and alternative approaches. Requiring agencies should  apply

specifications, standards, and related documents initially for guidance only, making final decisions

on the application and tailoring of these documents as a product of the design and development

process. Requiring agencies should  not dictate detailed design solutions prematurely (see [7.101](/part-7/7.101)  and

[7.105](/part-7/7.105) (a)(8)).

(d)

(1) Agencies shall  procure sustainable products and services  (as defined in [2.101](/part-2/2.101) ) in accordance

with subpart [23.1](/part-23/23.1)).

(2) Unless it is not practicable (see [23.104](/part-23/23.104) (a)) or an exception or exemption applies (see [23.105](/part-23/23.105)  and

[23.106](/part-23/23.106) , respectively), agencies shall  incorporate the use of sustainable products and services

when—

(i) Developing, reviewing, or revising Federal and military specifications, product descriptions

(including commercial item descriptions) and standards;

(ii) Describing Government requirements for products  and services; and

(iii) Developing source-selection factors.

(3) The Green Procurement  Compilation (GPC) available at https://sftool.gov/​greenprocurement

provides a comprehensive list of sustainable products and services  and other related sustainable

acquisition  guidance. Agencies should —

(i) Consult the GPC when determining which purchasing programs apply to a specific product or

service; and

(ii) Incorporate into agency requirements any required standards, specifications, or ecolabels

identified in the GPC for a specific product or service.

(e) Some or all of the performance levels or performance specifications in a solicitation  may be

identified as targets rather than as fixed or minimum requirements.

(f) In accordance with section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 ( 29 U.S.C. 794d ), the contracting

officer  shall  obtain from the requiring activity the requirement documents, which must  identify—

(1) The needs of current and future users with disabilities to determine how–

(i) Users with disabilities will perform the functions supported by the information and

communication technology (ICT );

(ii) The ICT will be developed, installed, configured and maintained to support users with

disabilities;

(2) The applicable ICT accessibility standards (see subpart  [39.2](/part-39/39.2) ); and

(3) Any ICT accessibility standards that cannot be met due to an exception or an exemption for any

component  or portion of the product (see [7.105](/part-7/7.105) (b)(5)(iv), [39.204](/part-39/39.204) , and [39.205](/part-39/39.205) ).

(g) Unless the agency Chief Information Officer waives the requirement, when acquiring information

technology  using Internet Protocol, the requirements documents must  include reference to the

appropriate technical capabilities defined in the USGv6 Profile (NIST Special Publication 500-267)

and the corresponding declarations of conformance defined in the USGv6 Test Program. The

applicability of IPv6 to agency networks, infrastructure, and applications specific to individual

acquisitions  will be in accordance with the agency's Enterprise Architecture (see OMB Memorandum

M-05-22 dated August 2, 2005).

(h) Agencies shall  not include in a solicitation  a requirement that prohibits an offeror  from

permitting its employees to telecommute unless the contracting officer  executes a written

determination in accordance with FAR [7.108](/part-7/7.108) (a).
