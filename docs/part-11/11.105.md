# 11.105 Items peculiar to one manufacturer

Agency requirements shall  not be written so as to require a particular brand name, product, or a

feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer, thereby precluding consideration of a product

manufactured by another company, unless-

(a)

(1) The particular brand name, product, or feature is essential to the Government’s requirements,

and market research  indicates other companies’ similar products , or products  lacking the particular

feature, do not meet, or cannot be modified to meet, the agency’s needs;

(2)

(i) The authority to contract without providing for full and open competition  is supported by the

required justifications and approvals (see [6.302-1](/part-6/6.302-1) ); or

(ii) The basis for not providing for maximum practicable competition is documented in the file (see

[13.106-1](/part-13/13.106-1) (b)) or justified (see [13.501](/part-13/13.501) ) when the acquisition  is awarded using simplified acquisition

procedures .

(3) The documentation or justification is posted for acquisitions  over $25,000. (See [5.102](/part-5/5.102) (a)(6).)

(b) For multiple award schedule orders, see [8.405-6](/part-8/8.405-6) .
