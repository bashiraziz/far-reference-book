# 45.600 Scope of subpart

This subpart establishes policies and procedures for the reporting, reutilization, and disposal of

contractor inventory excess to contracts and of property that forms the basis of a claim  against the

Government ( e.g., termination inventory  under fixed-price contracts). This subpart does not apply to

the disposal of real property or to property for which the Government has a lien or title solely as a

result of advance, progress, or performance-based payments that have been liquidated.
