# 17.502-2 (c)) is required by law or regulation, the servicing agency  shall  execute and issue the

justification and approval or D&F. The requesting agency  shall  furnish the servicing agency  any

information needed to make the justification and approval or D&F.

(2) The requesting agency  shall  also be responsible for furnishing other assistance that may be

necessary, such as providing information or special contract terms needed to comply with any

condition or limitation applicable to the funds of the requesting agency .

(3) The servicing agency  is responsible for compliance with all other legal or regulatory

requirements applicable to the contract, including-

(i) Having adequate statutory authority for the contractual action; and

(ii) Complying fully with the competition requirements of part  6  (see [6.002](/part-6/6.002) ). However, if the

servicing agency  is not subject to the Federal Acquisition  Regulation, the requesting agency  shall

verify that contracts utilized to meet its requirements contain provisions protecting the Government

from inappropriate charges (for example, provisions mandated for FAR agencies by part 31), and

that adequate contract administration will be provided.

(e) Nonsponsoring Federal agencies  may use a Federally Funded Research and Development Center

(FFRDC) only if the terms of the FFRDC’s sponsoring agreement permit work from other than a

sponsoring agency. Work placed with the FFRDC is subject to the acceptance by the sponsor and

must  fall within the purpose, mission, general scope of effort, or special competency  of the FFRDC.

(See [35.017](/part-35/35.017) ; see also [6.302](/part-6/6.302)  for procedures to follow where using other than full and open

competition .) The nonsponsoring agency shall  provide to the sponsoring agency necessary

documentation that the requested work would not place the FFRDC in direct competition with

domestic private industry.
