# 17.605 Award, renewal, and extension

(a) Effective work performance under management and operating contracts  usually involves high

levels of expertise and continuity of operations and personnel. Because of program requirements

and the unusual (sometimes unique) nature of the work performed under management and

operating contracts , the Government is often limited in its ability to effect competition or to replace

a contractor. Therefore contracting officers  should  take extraordinary steps before award to assure

themselves that the prospective contractor’s technical and managerial capacity are sufficient, that

organizational conflicts of interest are adequately covered, and that the contract will grant the

Government broad and continuing rights to involve itself, if necessary, in technical and managerial

decisionmaking concerning performance.

(b) The contracting officer  shall  review each management and operating contract , following agency

procedures, at appropriate intervals and at least once every 5 years. The review should  determine

whether meaningful improvement in performance or cost might reasonably be achieved. Any

extension or renewal of an operating and management contract must  be authorized at a level within

the agency no lower than the level at which the original contract was authorized in accordance with
