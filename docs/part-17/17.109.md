Contracts, in solicitations  and contracts when a multi-year contract is contemplated.

Standards- Price Adjustment (Multiple Year and Option  Contracts), when the contract includes the

clause at [52.222-41](/part-52/52.222-41) , Service Contract Labor Standards;

(2) May modify the clause at [52.222-43](/part-52/52.222-43)  in overseas contracts when laws, regulations, or

international agreements require contractors to pay higher wage rates; or
