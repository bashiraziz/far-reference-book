# 17.602 (a)

(c) Replacement of an incumbent contractor is usually based largely upon expectation of meaningful

improvement in performance or cost. Therefore, when reviewing contractor performance,

contracting officers  should  consider-

(1) The incumbent contractor’s overall performance, including, specifically, technical,

administrative, and cost performance;

(2) The potential impact of a change in contractors on program needs, including safety, national

defense , and mobilization considerations; and

(3) Whether it is likely that qualified offerors  will compete for the contract.
