# [PROJECT_NAME] Constitution
<!-- Example: Spec Constitution, TaskFlow Constitution, etc. -->

## Core Principles

### [REQUIREMENTS]
<!-- Example: I. Library-First -->
[PRINCIPLE_1_DESCRIPTION]
You are required to complete a unified book project using Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus. The core deliverables are:

1. AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation: Write a book using Docusaurus and deploy it to GitHub Pages. You will use Spec-Kit Plus ( https://github.com/panaversity/spec-kit-plus/ ) and Claude Code ( https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code ) to write the book. 

2. Integrated RAG Chatbot Development: Build and embed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot within the published book. This chatbot, utilizing the OpenAI Agents/ChatKit SDKs, FastAPI, Neon Serverless Postgres database, and Qdrant Cloud Free Tier, must be able to answer user questions about the book's content, including answering questions based only on text selected by the user.

3. Participants will receive points out of 100, for base functionality defined above. 

4. Participants can earn up to 50 extra bonus points by creating and using reusable intelligence via Claude Code Subagents and Agent Skills in the book project.

5. Participants can receive up to 50 extra bonus points if they also implement Signup and Signin using https://www.better-auth.com/ At signup you will ask questions from the user about their software and hardware background. Knowing the background of the user we will be able to personalize the content.

6.  Participants can receive up to 50 extra bonus points if the logged user can personalise the content in the chapters by pressing a button at the start of each chapter. 

7. Participants can receive up to 50 extra bonus points if the logged user can translate the content in Urdu in the chapters by pressing a button at the start of each chapter.
