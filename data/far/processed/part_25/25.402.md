# 25.402 General.

- (a) - (1) The Trade Agreements Act (19 U.S.C.2501, et seq.) provides the authority for the President to waive the Buy American statute and other discriminatory provisions for eligible products from countries that have signed an international trade agreement with the United States, or that meet certain other criteria, such as being a least developed country. The President has delegated this waiver authority to the U.S. Trade Representative. In acquisitions covered by the WTO GPA, Free Trade Agreements, or the Israeli Trade Act, the U.S. Trade Representative has waived the Buy American statute and other discriminatory provisions for eligible products. Offers of eligible products receive equal consideration with domestic offers. - (2) The contracting officer shall determine the origin of services by the country in which the firm providing the services is established. See subpart 25.5 for evaluation procedures for supply contracts covered by trade agreements. - (b) The value of the acquisition is a determining factor in the applicability of trade agreements. Most of these dollar thresholds are subject to revision by the U.S. Trade Representative approximately every 2 years. The various thresholds are summarized as follows: Table 1 to Paragraph (b) Trade Agreement Supply Contract (equal to or exceeding) Service Contract (equal to or exceeding) Construction Contract (equal to or exceeding) WTO GPA $174,000 $174,000 $6,708,000 FTAs Australia FTA 102,280 102,280 6,708,000 Bahrain FTA 174,000 174,000 13,296,489 CAFTA-DR (Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua) 102,280 102,280 6,708,000 Chile FTA 102,280 102,280 6,708,000 Colombia FTA 102,280 102,280 6,708,000 Korea FTA 100,000 100,000 6,708,000 Morocco FTA 174,000 174,000 6,708,000 USMCA -Mexico 102,280 102,280 13,296,489 Oman FTA 174,000 174,000 13,296,489 Panama FTA 174,000 174,000 6,708,000 Peru FTA 174,000 174,000 6,708,000 Singapore FTA 102,280 102,280 6,708,000 Israeli Trade Act 50,000 - -
