# 43.102 Policy.

- (a) Only contracting officers acting within the scope of their authority are empowered to execute contract modifications on behalf of the Government. Other Government personnel shall not- - (1) Execute contract modifications; - (2) Act in such a manner as to cause the contractor to believe that they have authority to bind the Government; or - (3) Direct or encourage the contractor to perform work that should be the subject of a contract modification. - (b) Contract modifications, including changes that could be issued unilaterally, shall be priced before their execution if this can be done without adversely affecting the interest of the Government. If a significant cost increase could result from a contract modification and time does not permit negotiation of a price, at least a ceiling price shall be negotiated unless impractical.
