# 31.602 General.

The OMB Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR part 200, subpart E and appendices V and VII sets forth the principles for determining the allowable costs of contracts and subcontracts with State, local, and federally recognized Indian tribal governments. These principles are for cost determination and are not intended to identify the circumstances or dictate the extent of Federal and State or local participation in financing a particular contract.
