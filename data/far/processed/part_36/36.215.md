# 36.215 Special procedure for cost-reimbursement contracts for construction.

Contracting officers may use a cost-reimbursement contract to acquire construction only when its use is consistent with subpart 16.3 and part 15 (see 15.404-4(c)(4)(i) for fee limitation on cost-reimbursement contracts).
