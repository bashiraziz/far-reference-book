10.001  Policy.
(a) Agencies shall —
(1) Ensure that legitimate needs are identified and trade-offs evaluated to acquire items that meet
those needs;
(2) Conduct market research  appropriate to the circumstances–
(i) Before developing new requirements documents for an acquisition  by that agency;
(ii) Before soliciting offers  for acquisitions  with an estimated value in excess of the simplified
acquisition threshold ;
(iii) Before soliciting offers  for acquisitions  with an estimated value less than the simplified
acquisition threshold  when adequate information is not available and the circumstances justify its
cost;
(iv) Before soliciting offers  for acquisitions  that could lead to consolidation or bundling  (15 U.S.C.
644(e)(2)(A) ) and 15 U.S.C. 657q );
(v) Before awarding a task or delivery order  under an indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (ID/IQ)
contract ( e.g., GWACs, MACs) for other than a commercial product  or commercial service  in excess
of the simplified acquisition threshold  (10 U.S.C. 3453(c) ); and
(vi) On an ongoing basis, take advantage (to the maximum extent practicable) of commercially
available market research  methods in order to effectively identify the capabilities of small businesses
and new entrants into Federal contracting  that are available in the marketplace for meeting the
requirements of the agency in furtherance of-

(A) A contingency operation  or defense against or recovery from cyber, nuclear, biological, chemical,
or radiological attack; and
(B) Disaster relief to include debris removal, distribution of supplies , reconstruction, and other
disaster or emergency  relief activities (See 26.205 ); and
(3) Use the results of market research  to–
(i) Determine if sources capable of satisfying the agency’s requirements exist;
(ii) Determine if commercial products  or commercial services , or, to the extent commercial products
suitable to meet the agency’s needs are not available, nondevelopmental items  are available that-
(A) Meet the agency’s requirements;
(B) Could be modified to meet the agency’s requirements; or
(C) Could meet the agency’s requirements if those requirements were modified to a reasonable
extent;
(iii) Determine the extent to which commercial products , or nondevelopmental items  could be
incorporated at the component  level;
(iv) Determine the practices of firms engaged in producing, distributing, and supporting commercial
products  or commercial services , such as type of contract, terms for warranties , buyer financing,
maintenance and packaging, and marking;
(v) Ensure maximum practicable use of sustainable products and services  (as defined in 2.101 ) in
accordance with subpart  23.1 ;
(vi) Determine whether consolidation is necessary and justified (see 7.107-2 ) (15 U.S.C. 657q );
(vii) Determine whether bundling  is necessary and justified (see 7.107-3 ) (15 U.S.C. 644(e)(2)(A) );
(viii) Determine whether the acquisition  should  utilize any of the small business programs in
accordance with part  19 ; and
(ix) Assess the availability of supplies  or services that meet all or part of the applicable information
and communication technology  accessibility standards at 36 CFR 1194.1  (see subpart  39.2 ).
(b) When conducting market research , agencies should  not request potential sources to submit more
than the minimum information necessary.
(c) If an agency contemplates consolidation or bundling , the agency—
(1) When performing market research , should  consult with the agency small business specialist and
the local Small Business Administration procurement  center representative (PCR). If a PCR is not
assigned, see 19.402 (a); and
(2) Shall  notify any affected incumbent small business concerns of the Government's intention to
bundle the requirement and how small business concerns may contact the appropriate Small
Business Administration procurement  center representative (see 7.107-5 (a)).
(d) See 10.003  for the requirement for a prime contractor to perform market research  in contracts in

excess of $7.5 million , other than contracts for the acquisition  of commercial products  or
commercial services  (section 826 of Pub. L. 110-181).
10.002  Procedures.
(a) Acquisitions  begin with a description of the Government’s needs stated in terms sufficient to
allow conduct of market research .
(b) Market research  is then conducted to determine if commercial products , commercial services , or
nondevelopmental items  are available to meet the Government’s needs or could be modified to meet
the Government’s needs.
(1) The extent of market research  will vary, depending on such factors as urgency, estimated dollar
value, complexity, and past experience. The contracting officer  may use market research  conducted
within 18 months before the award of any task or delivery order  if the information is still current,
accurate, and relevant. Market research  involves obtaining information specific to the product or
service being acquired and should  include-
(i) Whether the Government’s needs can be met by-
(A) Products  or services of a type customarily available in the commercial marketplace;
(B) Products  or services of a type customarily available in the commercial marketplace with
modifications; or
(C) Products  or services used exclusively for governmental purposes;
(ii) Customary practices regarding customizing, modifying or tailoring of products  or services to
meet customer needs and associated costs;
(iii) Customary practices, including warranty , buyer financing, discounts, contract type considering
the nature and risk associated with the requirement, etc., under which commercial sales of the
products  or services are made;
(iv) The requirements of any laws and regulations unique to the item being acquired;
(v) The availability of items that contain recovered materials  and items that are energy efficient;
(vi) The distribution and support capabilities of potential suppliers, including alternative
arrangements and cost estimates; and
(vii) Whether the Government's needs can be met by small business concerns that will likely submit
a competitive offer  at fair market prices (see part  19 ).
(2) Techniques for conducting market research  may include any or all of the following:
(i) Contacting knowledgeable individuals in Government and industry regarding market capabilities
to meet requirements.
(ii) Reviewing the results of recent market research  undertaken to meet similar or identical
requirements.

(iii) Publishing formal requests for information in appropriate technical or scientific journals or
business publications.
(iv) Querying the Governmentwide database of contracts and other procurement  instruments
intended for use by multiple agencies available at
https://www.contractdirectory.gov/contractdirectory/  and other Government and commercial
databases that provide information relevant to agency acquisitions .
(v) Participating in interactive, on-line communication among industry, acquisition  personnel, and
customers.
(vi) Obtaining source lists of similar items from other contracting activities  or agencies, trade
associations or other sources.
(vii) Reviewing catalogs and other generally available product literature published by
manufacturers, distributors, and dealers or available on-line.
(viii) Conducting interchange meetings or holding presolicitation conferences to involve potential
offerors  early in the acquisition  process.
(ix) Reviewing systems such as the System for Award Management , the Federal Procurement  Data
System, and the Small Business Administration's Dynamic Small Business Search.
(c) If market research  indicates commercial products , commercial services , or nondevelopmental
items  might not be available to satisfy agency needs, agencies shall  reevaluate the need in
accordance with 10.001 (a)(3)(ii) and determine whether the need can be restated to permit
commercial products , commercial services , or nondevelopmental items  to satisfy the agency’s needs.
(d)
(1) If market research  establishes that the Government’s need may be met by a type of product or
service customarily available in the commercial marketplace that would meet the definition of a
commercial product  or commercial service  at subpart  2.1 , the contracting officer  shall  solicit and
award any resultant contract using the policies and procedures in part  12 .
(2) If market research  establishes that the Government’s need cannot be met by a type of item or
service customarily available in the marketplace, part  12  shall  not be used. When publication of the
notice at 5.201  is required, the contracting officer  shall  include a notice to prospective offerors  that
the Government does not intend to use part  12  for the acquisition .
(e) The head of the agency  shall  document the results of market research  in a manner appropriate to
the size and complexity of the acquisition .
10.003  Contract clause.
The contracting officer  shall  insert the clause at 52.210-1 , Market Research , in solicitations  and
