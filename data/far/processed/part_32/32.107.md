# 32.107 Need for contract financing not a deterrent.

- (a) If the contractor or offeror meets the standards prescribed for responsible prospective contractors at 9.104, the contracting officer shall not treat the contractor’s need for contract financing as a handicap for a contract award; e.g., as a responsibility factor or evaluation criterion. - (b) The contractor should not be disqualified from contract financing solely because the contractor failed to indicate a need for contract financing before the contract was awarded.
